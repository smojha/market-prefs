During the practice rounds, I aimed to use speculative orders by setting buy and sell limits slightly below and above the market price to capitalize on minor price fluctuations. However, my orders did not execute, which indicates that the market prices remained stable or my limits were not set optimally. The practice rounds show a relatively stable market with prices hovering around 14 to 15, suggesting limited volatility. This stability provides a safe environment for accumulating dividends if the trend continues but also challenges speculative strategies since trades did not execute at the limits set. Moving forward, I might consider refining my limit order pricing to align more closely with observed market prices, adjusting them slightly based on observed increments from previous practice rounds. Considering the stock's final conversion value is 14, I need to be cautious around periods close to round 30 about buying stocks over this value unless a strategic opportunity presents itself. In addition, the consistent failure of forecasts to lead to rewards suggests a need for greater accuracy or a more systematic prediction model. Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into the importance of aligning strategies with market stability and adjusting forecasts actively.
