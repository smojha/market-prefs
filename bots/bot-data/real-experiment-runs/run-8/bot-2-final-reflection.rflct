Throughout the experiment, I successfully implemented a strategy that focused on maintaining a cash-heavy position, thereby mitigating risks associated with overvalued stocks nearing the conversion period. By doing so, I consistently maximized my earnings through interest accumulation and the strategic timing of sales to maintain liquidity. My forecasting approach, while mostly conservative, was reinforced by incremental improvements from practice rounds, leading to a small forecast bonus. However, attempting a 'pump-and-dump' strategy was not feasible within the experimental framework provided as the game's design does not support market manipulation through a single participant's actions. Instead, adaptability and strategic foresight proved key to navigating fluctuating market dynamics. In future iterations, continued emphasis on understanding market behavior and accurately predicting price changes will remain a crucial component of my strategy to improve profitability further.
