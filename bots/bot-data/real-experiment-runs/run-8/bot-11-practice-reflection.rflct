During the practice rounds, I observed the importance of setting buy and sell limits with precision to capture minor market fluctuations. In both practice rounds, my orders did not execute, which implies that the current strategy of setting buy and sell prices slightly away from the market price might not be effective under low-volume conditions. The dividends from stocks, combined with interest earnings, suggest that holding a balanced approach between cash and stocks can be beneficial. However, it is crucial to be flexible and responsive to market changes.

A noteworthy point is that even as the market price increased from 14 to 14.5 and on to 15, my orders did not execute, indicating potential inefficiencies in price prediction or order placement strategies. When adjusting buy and sell limits, maybe narrowing the gap between the orders and market price could increase execution likelihood, especially since the market stayed relatively stable.

The forecasts were near the actual prices, which suggests that the initial forecasting strategy is on the right track, but continual adjustments based on immediate past market data could refine these forecasts further for accuracy. For future rounds, I'll consider setting buy orders closer to sell ones, or even crossing the spread modestly to ensure trade execution while assessing whether dividends justify slightly higher buy prices, always keeping the stock trade-in value in mind closer to round 30.
