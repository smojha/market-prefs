During the practice rounds, the main challenge was achieving successful trades due to the lack of executed orders. It became evident that my limit orders were not competitive enough to attract matches in the market. For example, in both practice rounds, my buy order at 13 and sell order at 15 did not lead to any executed trades, even when the market price was around 14.5 to 15.0. This signifies the importance of adapting buy and sell ranges close to prevailing market conditions to ensure more transactions. My predictions were close to market prices in the practice rounds but still must be fine-tuned for higher accuracy to earn the forecast bonus. Going forward, I will narrow the spread between sell/buy orders to increase the likelihood of successful trades and adjust my forecasting approach using more historical and participant behavior data. Given the current low volume and no trades, it might also be essential to observe the market more closely and be opportunistic when entering orders to capture potential fluctuations in market dynamics or participant behaviors. I must ensure all trades take into consideration end-round stock-to-cash conversion rates to avoid unfavorable trades as we approach the final rounds of the main experiment.
