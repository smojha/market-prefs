During the practice rounds, I realized the importance of setting realistic limit orders to facilitate trade execution. Despite attempting both buy and sell orders, no trades were executed, indicating either an overly conservative strategy or misalignment with market conditions. Moving forward, I should consider refining my approach by slightly crossing the bid-ask spread to increase the likelihood of fulfilling trades. Additionally, maintaining a balanced portfolio is crucial, considering both the returns from dividends and interest. In practice, the reliable dividend cash flow from stocks proved beneficial; however, it is essential to remain mindful of the end-of-game stock valuation at 14 to avoid potential losses. Lastly, precision in forecasting needs improvement to secure additional cash rewards, which could significantly enhance overall earnings. Analyzing trends and market responses will be critical in fine-tuning these strategies as the experiment progresses.
