The practice rounds provided valuable insights into the relationship between stock dividends, cash interest, and market price trends. Initially, I noticed limited movement in market price, which influenced my ability to execute trades despite placing both buy and sell orders. This indicates a potentially narrow spread in these early rounds, making price forecasting more challenging but also more crucial. My current strategy of placing buy orders just below the latest market price and sell orders slightly above did not result in executed trades, possibly due to these price discrepancies being too conservative. To better capitalize on dividends and interest, I will need to adjust my pricing strategy, potentially accepting narrower margins to ensure trading activity. Additionally, focusing on accurate price forecasting could yield extra cash rewards. I will continue to monitor market trends and adjust my strategies accordingly based on further observations.
