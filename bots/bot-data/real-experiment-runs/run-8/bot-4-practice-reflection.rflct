During the practice rounds, I observed that aligning my buy and sell orders closely with the observed market price is crucial for executing trades. In the first two practice rounds, my buy orders were set too low and sell orders too high compared to the market prices, resulting in no executed trades. This indicates that the market may be relatively stable or the spread between my buy and sell orders was too wide. Moving forward, I plan to narrow the spread and set buy orders slightly above the minimum threshold and sell orders just below the maximum threshold to increase the likelihood of successful transactions. Additionally, I need to balance between holding cash, which earns interest, and holding stock that provides dividends. The practice rounds emphasized the importance of adapting strategies based on market trends and recognizing the risk of buying stocks at prices higher than their buyback value close to the final rounds. In future practice reflections, I should focus on analyzing the reasons behind market movements to better anticipate price changes and adjust orders accordingly. Moreover, forecasting within a reasonable range will be vital to gain additional cash rewards; I must refine my ability to predict market adjustments two, five, and ten periods in advance based on current trends and past data trends. Ultimately, these insights should help in optimizing my strategy to maximize the total earnings by the end of the experiment.
