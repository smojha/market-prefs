During the practice periods, my strategy focused on placing conservative BUY orders at a price below current market levels and SELL orders at prices representing potential gains based on future market trends. This was intended to limit risk and leverage potential dividends and market price increase. However, none of my trades were executed in the first two practice rounds, indicating that my strategy might have been too conservative given the current market dynamics, as reflected in a market price increase from 14 to 15 over two rounds with no market volume recorded. 

Given the trade-in value of stock at 14, there's limited risk holding onto shares while concurrently buying when prices are low as long as they are at or below 14. The opportunity lies in anticipating price movements and adjusting forecast accordingly to benefit from additional reward for forecast accuracy. 

In the upcoming rounds, I should consider adjusting buy prices more aggressively to enable trade execution and ensure active participation in the market. Given that stocks are converted at 14 after round 30, maintaining or increasing current stock levels at favorable prices maximizes potential dividends while the cash continues to gain interest. Additionally, planning for a gradual exit strategy by holding back some CASH for the latter rounds could help safeguard against unfavorable market conditions. This strategy needs continual reassessment as I gain more insights into the market behavior during the experimental rounds.
