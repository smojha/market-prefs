During the practice rounds, I observed that my submitted limit orders were not executed, indicating that my price points were not competitive enough to participate in the market. The dividends fluctuated between 0.4 and 1.0, but the market price showed a gradual increase from 14.0 to 15.0. This suggests that dividends may not have an immediate, strong impact on market prices, but they do contribute to cash earnings, which allows more flexibility in investing over time. My forecasts were not met with extra cash from accurate predictions, emphasizing the necessity of refining my forecasting to align more closely with market movements. The exercise highlighted the importance of actively participating in the market by setting limit orders that are close to the current market price while respecting the maximum trade-in value of 14 to ensure profit from any shares held close to the experiment's end. Going forward, I need to be more aggressive in pricing my buy and sell orders to enhance the likelihood of execution, especially as market conditions remain fluid. Additionally, I should review my forecasting method to improve accuracy and make calculated adjustments based on historical data and observed patterns. This reflection helps me understand the patience needed in trading and the critical importance of balancing both long-term and short-term strategies to maximize the overall earnings by the end of the experiment.
