During the experiment, my primary objective was to optimize my gains by leveraging both the trading activities and accurate price forecasts. Reflecting on my strategy throughout the 30 rounds, I observed the significance of balancing STOCK assets against CASH, particularly with the buyback constraint of 14 CASH per share in the final round. Early on, I realized the importance of forecasting accuracy since being within 2.5 units of the actual price resulted in valuable bonuses. The consistent market price around 15 facilitated my strategy to consolidate stocks and aim for more opportunities with dividend earnings while also strategically increasing my CASH reserves for liquidity. By round 22, divestment of my STOCKS allowed maximizing CASH growth through interest, allowing me to mitigate risks associated with potential price crashes or stock devaluation. Although the initial aim was a 'pump-and-dump' strategy, adaptation was necessary to focus on steady gains instead, considering peer actions and market stability. This shift ensured that by rounds 25-30, I sustained a viable position with total earnings of $15.64. Moving forward, I recognize the value of flexibility in real-time strategy adjustments and the critical importance of accurate forecasting in experimental trading environments.
