During the practice rounds, I've observed that the market price hovered around the conversion value of 14. Despite submitting limit orders to buy below and sell above the market price, no trades were executed. This suggests the market was more stable than anticipated, and my orders might have been too conservative to initiate trades. As such, it might be beneficial to adjust order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of completing trades. Additionally, the stable nature of the market around the price of 14 reinforces the conversion value as an anchor point for future trading decisions. The insights gained also stress the importance of balancing between buying shares at a favorable price and accumulating cash to benefit from interest accrual. Moving forward, strategic adjustments in order pricing and portfolio balance could improve overall earnings by facilitating more active participation in the market while preparing for the end-of-experiment stock conversion. Future strategies should also incorporate more dynamic price forecasting, leveraging historical data and market trends to enhance forecast winnings.
