Through the practice rounds, I have observed that the conservative strategy of setting buy orders below and sell orders above the current market price has resulted in no executed trades due to static market prices. The market prices have varied minimally, suggesting a low volatility environment, or potentially low trading activity among participants. My starting strategy was to avoid purchasing stock above its trade-in value and to sell stock at a higher price than its potential future value. However, this has left me without any executed trades. To improve, I plan to slightly adjust my buy and sell limits to be closer to the last known market price to better probe market dynamics and participant behavior. Additionally, paying careful attention to the market volume and order execution, or lack thereof, can provide insights into market activity and help fine-tune the strategies moving forward. Forecasting rewards add an additional incentive to accurately predict market trends, so I will pay attention to data supporting any pricing trends or patterns over multiple periods to enhance prediction accuracy. Overall, an adaptive approach, adjusting strategies as new market dynamics are revealed, will be crucial for maximizing earnings.
