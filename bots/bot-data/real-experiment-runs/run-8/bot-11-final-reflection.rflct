Throughout the experiment, the market revealed a relatively stable behavior with stock prices hovering around 14-15. My approach to executing a pump-and-dump strategy involved attempting to manipulate the market by strategically placing orders to inflate prices. However, market forces seemed resistant to drastic or sustained increases in price, likely due to the action of other market participants and the rules of the market itself. 

The key insight from this experiment was the realization of the limited control one can exert over an efficient market with numerous participants. While the idea of a pump-and-dump strategy relies on inflating prices through coordinated manipulation, the stable reaction of the market highlighted the potential futility of such tactics in this setting without significant capital or coordination involved. 

As the trading rounds neared the end, the emphasis shifted towards preventing any holding value loss. Selling stocks close to or just above the buyback price, especially when realizing the market price wouldn't significantly rise, proved to be a crucial adjustment to preserve our earnings.

Future strategies should consider the resilient nature of markets and potentially focus on adaptive, small-scale buying and selling to exploit minor fluctuations in market sentiment. The tactical intent should be on valuing data-driven decision-making over trying to force market direction contrary to its natural course.
