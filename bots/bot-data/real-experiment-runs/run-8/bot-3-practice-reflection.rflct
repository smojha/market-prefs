During the practice rounds, I've noticed that my initial strategy of setting buy order prices below the market price at 14 didn't result in any executed trades as the market prices hovered around mid-range values (14.5 to 15). This indicates that the market participants are potentially anticipating higher dividend payouts or future price increases, leading to no sell-offs at my initial lower buy prices. Thus, increasing the buy limit to 14 was not enough, as seen in practice rounds where market prices stayed above this. Similarly, my conservative sell orders weren't executed either, indicating the need to reassess the spread between the buy and sell prices to make them more realistic and responsive to the current market conditions. In these reflections, I've also confirmed the expected market behavior of prices being around or slightly above the trade-in amount of 14, driven by the dividend payouts. Moving forward, a more proactive strategy could involve setting buy prices closer to or slightly above market prices, especially if indicators hint at increasing future dividends or market confidence. On the sell-side, a slight reduction in sell prices might help execute trades if the spread remains small. Continuous adjustment and responsiveness to market feedback are crucial to maximize outcomes, given the tight margins and importance of strategic positioning.
