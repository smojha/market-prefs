Reflecting on the practice rounds, a few insights have emerged. Firstly, the market price hovered around 14-15, which is close to the STOCK trade-in value of 14. This suggests that the genuine value of the STOCK might be anchored around this price, making aggressive buying or selling around these levels potentially less profitable unless a significant market trend is identified. Despite placing buy and sell limit orders slightly below and above market price respectively, no trades were executed, indicating a possible need to cross the spread or adjust orders based on market activity to achieve trades.

Additionally, holding both CASH and STOCK concurrently provides a balance between guaranteed interest/dividend income and potential capital gains from stock trading. The continuous dividends and interest generated are reassuring, and they enforce the need for a flexible strategy that accommodates both rental and speculative aspects of the assets.

In future strategies, paying attention to market price trends will be crucial for entering and exiting positions optimally. Ensuring adequate CASH reserves for tactical moves or in response to market volatility remains paramount. I also recognize the importance of adapting strategies based on ongoing market behavior, as initially noted, which will be critical during the actual trading rounds for maximizing potential earnings.
