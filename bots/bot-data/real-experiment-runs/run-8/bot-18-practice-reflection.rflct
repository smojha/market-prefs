Reflecting on the practice rounds, I observed a consistent lack of executed trades despite placing buy orders slightly below market value and sell orders above. The practice market did not react to these positions, indicating that the orders were set either too far from expected price movement or the market experienced low trading activity. Going forward, some key insights can be applied:

1. **Adjust Price Offers**: I should consider narrowing the spread between buy and sell orders to increase the chances of execution. By placing buy orders closer to market price (e.g., around 14.5) while slightly lowering my sell prices (e.g., around 15.5), I might align better with market trends.

2. **Market Dynamics**: Understanding that the market can stall without executed trades at stable price points, future strategies should involve monitoring for market shifts and adjusting offers rapidly in highly volatile periods.

3. **Cash Flow Management**: While making offers closer to the trade-in value, it's vital to maintain sufficient cash flow to capitalize on undervalued stocks if a price dip occurs. Balancing spending and retaining cash for future rounds can maximize overall gains.

4. **Forecast Adaptation**: My initial forecasts were generally conservative, aiming to benefit from rounding dividends and stable returns. Reassessing forecasts by incorporating recent market behavior and volume trends might improve those predictions for additional rewards.

Overall, practice rounds highlighted the need for more reactive order strategies and maintaining flexibility with rapidly changing market conditions in pursuit of maximizing returns during the main experimental rounds.
