During the practice rounds, I observed a critical aspect of the market dynamics: the market price hovered close to the buyback price, which suggests a cautious approach is necessary when considering buying or selling STOCK as the round progresses. No executed trades occurred during the practice sessions, indicating that my bids and asks might have been too conservative, as they did not match the liquidity in the market. For future strategies, I consider adjusting my orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of executing trades. Furthermore, consistent forecasting could be crucial for additional earnings, so I will refine my predictions based on observable market behaviors. Finally, understanding the balance between potential dividends and guaranteed returns from cash interest is vital, especially given the fixed buyback price of 14, which requires careful market engagement as we approach later experimental rounds.
