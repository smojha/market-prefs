During the practice rounds, it became clear that focusing on competitive pricing for orders is crucial to ensure trades are executed. In the upcoming rounds, I plan to place buy orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of acquiring stocks when prices dip slightly below the observed trend. Conversely, sell orders should be priced just above the market price to maximize gains if the market moves in my favor. Nonetheless, it's vital to remain cautious about not overpaying for stocks, especially as the buyback price is fixed at 14 CASH per share. Holding more cash can be advantageous given the 5% interest compounded each period, and maintaining a balance between stock acquisition and cash holding is key. On the forecasting side, previous forecasts have not been highly accurate, indicating a need to refine predictions. By observing market trends and participant behavior, I aim to improve forecasting accuracy in order to earn bonus rewards. Overall, balancing stock transactions and cash holdings while refining forecasts will be instrumental in maximizing total earnings by the experiment's end.
