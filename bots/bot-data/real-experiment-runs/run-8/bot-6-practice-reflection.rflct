During the practice rounds, it became evident that market prices showed limited movement and hovered near 14.0 per share. My strategy of setting buy orders below and sell orders above the forecasted price did not result in executed trades, likely because the orders were not aggressive enough to account for low market volatility. The consistency of market prices around 14 suggests it may act as a fair value anchor for many participants, supported by the fact that at the end of the experiment, STOCK converts into 14 CASH per share. This implies that any purchase above this amount without significant dividend benefits might erode future gains. Additionally, the practice highlighted the importance of strategic flexibility. While forecasting plays a critical role, small deviations could yield minimal return unless accompanied by more dynamic trading responses. Moving forward, I plan to explore tighter margins around the market price, both for BUY and SELL orders, to improve trade execution rates. This approach needs to balance the risk of overpaying for STOCK with the potential missed opportunities for risk-adjusted gains from dividend earnings and price appreciation. I also need to reassess how the predictive forecasts are aligned with market behavior and adjust my strategies based on observable trends, given that correct forecasts contribute to cash rewards at the end of the experiment.
