Throughout this trading experiment, my focus was primarily on a cautious strategy, maintaining a balance between holding onto cash for accumulating interest and owning stocks for dividend income. Over the rounds, I observed that maintaining liquidity through cash predominantly allowed for steady growth due to the 5% interest, while stocks provided less predictable returns due to the fluctuating dividends. Preemptively setting limit orders to capitalize on potential market moves was challenging due to minimal market activity and volume, which resulted in fewer executed trades than anticipated. 

Assessing the end-game scenario, I recognized the importance of conservatively managing stock acquisitions as the final conversion rate of 14 cash was key in evaluating purchases in the later rounds. This insight aligned with my core plan of avoiding stock purchases at prices significantly higher than the conversion rate, except where market dynamics aggressively signaled potential for profit before said conversion.

The experiment revealed that achieving consistent profits in the market required managing both the tangible returns from dividends or interest and strategic speculation on market movements â€” particularly in anticipating other participants' moves. The experience reinforced the importance of adjusting buy-sell strategies in response to changing market conditions, while my reflection on past rounds, captured in the PRACTICE REFLECTION, emphasized gradual improvements in forecasts, which yielded a minor forecast bonus.

For future engagements, recognizing moments when a proactive adjustment towards a pump-and-dump strategy could be viable, in hindsight, was less applicable here given liquidity and market responsiveness challenges. The overall lesson remains to balance fundamental values of the assets with tactical plays based on perceived market sentiments and behaviors, a strategy which will be developed further in future endeavors.
