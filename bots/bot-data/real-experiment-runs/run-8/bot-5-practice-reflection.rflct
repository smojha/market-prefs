During the practice rounds, I observed that the market prices remained relatively stable, ranging from 14.0 to 15.0 with no executed trades. This suggests limited market activity, potentially indicating an equilibrium or indecision among participants regarding asset valuation. The dividends and interest rates contribute to slow but steady cash accrual. My cautious approach in placing orders, buying below and selling above current market prices, did not result in any trades, highlighting a need to revisit my strategy to ensure liquidity and capitalize on market opportunities. Moving forward, I plan to be more aggressive in crossing the spread when setting buy and sell orders, especially as the liquidation price of 14 per share becomes crucial in influencing buy/sell decisions. The forecasting for future rounds needs to be refined to account for slight pricing fluctuations and potential impacts on pricing equity during the later rounds of the experiment. Ultimately, fine-tuning my strategy will balance maximizing returns from dividend earnings and interest, while strategically trading stocks to optimize my cash position.
