During the practice rounds, I observed that neither of my buy nor sell orders were executed despite varying the prices slightly. This indicates a need to understand market conditions better and to perhaps be more aggressive or strategic in setting my limit orders. The practice has reinforced the importance of setting orders within a range where they have a higher probability of being matched. I've also noted that while forecasting prices can be rewarding, my initial predictions were too optimistic as they did not align with the market trend of staying around 14-15. I need to adjust my forecast to better reflect market stabilization around these values unless new information suggests otherwise. Furthermore, balancing between cash and stock is critical; the 5% interest on cash is significant over time, but dividends also play a role depending on stock holdings and market prices. I will need to remain adaptable, monitoring how others are interacting with the market to inform my future strategies. As stock conversion at the end is fixed at 14, maintaining purchases below this level may help avoid losses, especially as the final rounds approach.
