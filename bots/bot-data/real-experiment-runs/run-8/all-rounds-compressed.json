Strategies should focus on minor adjustments around the forecasted 15 mark, considering the conversion risk at round 30. Fine-tuning buy/sell orders closer to this central value, based on trial rounds, could enhance execution chances, especially in low-volatility conditions. Foreseen price deviations should be minimal, given current market behavior.",
