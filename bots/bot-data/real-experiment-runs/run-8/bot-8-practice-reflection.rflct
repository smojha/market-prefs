During the practice rounds, I've observed that the market is currently experiencing low trading volumes, suggesting that participants are cautious and waiting for clearer market trends. My strategy of placing buy orders slightly below the last market price and sell orders slightly above did not result in any executed trades. However, it allowed me to gauge the market's potential resistance levels. With the market price slowly increasing from 14.0 to 15.0, it might be beneficial to adjust my order prices closer to the market rate to potentially capture some trades. The consistent, though modest, growth in market price indicates a slight upward trend, which may continue if no significant changes occur in user behavior. In the future rounds, I'll aim to adjust my orders incrementally and remain adaptive to any emerging patterns. Managing risk by keeping the buy price close to the trade-in value is also crucial to avoid potential losses. Moreover, accurate forecasting remains important, as it's a consistent source of additional earnings. Continuous adaptation and observations of market responses are key to maximizing overall returns.
