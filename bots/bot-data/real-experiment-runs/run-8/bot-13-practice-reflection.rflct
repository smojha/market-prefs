After analyzing the practice rounds, it is evident that aligning buy and sell orders with current market trends is crucial to executing successful trades. The lack of executed trades in the first two practice rounds highlights the need to adjust order prices closer to the market prices while maintaining a buffer to avoid buying overvalued stocks. Furthermore, considering the dividend potential and interest earnings, maintaining a balance between CASH reserves for interest benefits and STOCK for dividend earnings is essential. Going forward, I plan to adopt a more dynamic approach by adjusting order prices based on recent market activity and forecasts while keeping in mind the ultimate stock trade-in value of 14. By doing so, I aim to maximize overall returns through both trading activities and forecast accuracy. Finally, it's important to keep some flexibility in strategy, as other participants' behaviors might shift, influencing market dynamics and creating opportunities for more aggressive trading.
