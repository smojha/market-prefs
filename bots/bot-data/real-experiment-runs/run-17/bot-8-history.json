The buyback price of 14 is a critical benchmark for decision-making, especially as we near the end of the experiment. Balancing between holding stocks for dividends and maintaining cash for interest and future purchases remains essential. The market's inactivity suggests a need for more aggressive or adjusted limit prices to engage in trading.",
