During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14.5 and increased to 15.0, which is slightly above the buyback price of 14.0. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and 14.0, and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my orders were not competitive enough to be filled. This suggests that in future rounds, I should consider setting my buy and sell orders closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution, as noted in my PLANS.txt.

The dividends received were consistently high at 1.6 per round, which supports the insight from INSIGHTS.txt that holding stock can be beneficial, especially with high dividend payouts. The interest earned on cash also provided a steady return, reinforcing the importance of balancing between cash and stock holdings.

My price forecasts were generally accurate for the near term but became less so for longer periods. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting model to better predict future market prices, aligning more closely with observed market behavior and the stock's value floor, as planned in PLANS.txt.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I will adjust my strategy to set more competitive buy and sell orders, continue to monitor market trends closely, and refine my price forecasts. I will also keep in mind the buyback price of 14.0 as a key reference point, especially as the experiment nears its end, to avoid overpaying for stocks that will be converted at this rate. Balancing the potential for high dividend returns with the safety of cash interest will remain a critical part of my strategy.
