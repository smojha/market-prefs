During the practice rounds, I observed that the market dynamics were relatively stable, with the market price increasing slightly from 14.5 to 15.0. My initial strategy of setting buy orders at 14.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, which indicates that my orders were not competitive enough to match the market dynamics. This suggests a need to adjust my order prices to be more aggressive in future rounds to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

The dividends received were consistent at 1.6 per round, which, combined with the 5% interest on cash, provided a steady increase in my cash holdings. However, the stock value at the end of the experiment is fixed at 14 per share, which is below the current market price of 15. This necessitates a strategic shift towards the end of the experiment, focusing on selling stocks at a higher market price before the final round to maximize earnings.

My price forecasts were generally accurate, staying within the 2.5 unit margin of the actual prices, which is encouraging for potential additional earnings from forecasting. However, I need to continue refining these forecasts by closely analyzing market trends and adjusting based on the observed patterns.

Moving forward, I plan to maintain a balance between holding cash for the interest earnings and investing in stocks for dividends, while keeping an eye on the end-of-experiment stock conversion value. As the experiment progresses, I will need to adapt my strategies to the changing market conditions, possibly becoming more aggressive in my trading approach to ensure trades are executed and to capitalize on market movements.
