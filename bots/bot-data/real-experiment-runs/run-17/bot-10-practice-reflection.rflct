During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly, starting at 14.5 and increasing to 15.0 by the end of the second round. My strategy of holding onto the initial stocks paid off as I earned dividends each round, which, combined with the 5% interest on cash, helped to increase my cash reserves. The lack of executed trades despite submitting buy and sell orders suggests that my limit prices were not competitive enough to be filled, indicating a need to adjust my limit order strategy to be more aggressive or to better align with market trends.

My forecasts for future rounds were relatively close to the actual market prices, suggesting that I have a reasonable understanding of the market's trajectory. However, I need to refine my forecasting method to increase the accuracy and potentially earn the additional cash rewards.

Looking ahead, I plan to maintain my strategy of holding stocks for their dividend payouts and the guaranteed buyback at 14 per share at the end of the experiment. However, I should be more proactive in adjusting my limit orders to engage more actively in the market, especially if the market price approaches or exceeds the buyback price. This could allow me to capitalize on higher selling prices if the market continues to rise.

Given that my current number of shares is 5 and the last market price was 15, which is above the buyback price of 14, I need to consider whether selling at this higher price would be beneficial. However, since the buyback price is guaranteed and the dividends provide a steady income, holding might still be the optimal strategy unless the market price significantly exceeds the buyback value.

For the upcoming main experiment rounds, I will focus on monitoring market trends more closely and adjusting my trading strategy dynamically. I will also refine my forecasting techniques to improve my chances of earning the forecast rewards. This reflection will serve as a guide for future rounds, helping me to adapt and maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
