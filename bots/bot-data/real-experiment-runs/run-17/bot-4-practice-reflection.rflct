During the practice rounds, I tested various trading strategies and made several observations that will guide my approach in the main experiment. The Conservative Strategy of placing buy and sell orders close to the market price did not result in any trades, suggesting that the market might be less liquid than anticipated or that other participants are also cautious. The Aggressive Strategy, where I placed orders significantly away from the market price, also failed to execute any trades, indicating that the market might not respond well to aggressive pricing. The Hold Strategy, where I kept my stocks to accumulate dividends and benefit from the final conversion rate, seemed the most effective during these rounds as it allowed me to earn dividends and interest without the risk of trading.

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of the final conversion rate of stocks to cash at 14 units per share. This rate should heavily influence my strategy as we approach the end of the experiment, especially considering that the market price in the last practice round was 15, higher than the conversion rate. This suggests a potential for profit if I can sell stocks at or above the market price before the final round, but also a risk if the market price falls below 14.

For price forecasting, my predictions were mostly accurate for the immediate future but became less reliable as the forecast period extended. This indicates that I need to refine my forecasting method, possibly by incorporating more recent market trends and volatility.

Moving forward, I plan to continue using a combination of the Conservative and Hold Strategies. I will place conservative buy and sell orders to test market liquidity and responsiveness while maintaining a significant portion of my portfolio in stocks to benefit from dividends and the final conversion rate. I will also adjust my price forecasts more dynamically based on the latest market data and trends observed during the experiment. As we near the end of the 30 rounds, I will focus more on selling stocks at a favorable market price if it exceeds the conversion rate, to maximize my earnings.
