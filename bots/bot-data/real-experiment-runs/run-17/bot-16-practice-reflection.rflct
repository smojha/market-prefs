During the practice rounds, I observed that the market dynamics are influenced significantly by the dividend announcements and the buyback price of the stock. My initial strategy of setting limit orders at 13.0 to buy and 15.0 to sell did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my orders were not competitive enough to meet the market's price sensitivity. This was evident in the first round where no trades occurred, and the market price slightly decreased from 14.5 to 14.0, suggesting a market adjustment in the absence of trades.

In the second round, although the market price increased to 15.0 and there was a single trade, my orders still did not execute. This further reinforces the need to adjust my limit prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. The increase in market price also suggests that other participants may be anticipating higher dividends or a higher final buyback value, which I should consider in my strategy.

My current portfolio at the end of the second practice round shows a stable holding of 4 shares with a market value of 60.0, and my cash position has grown due to interest earnings and dividends. This balance between cash and stock has been beneficial, as it allows me to leverage both interest earnings and potential stock price increases.

Looking forward, I plan to refine my price forecasting based on observed trends and use these forecasts to inform my trading decisions more effectively. The buyback price of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment is a critical factor, as it sets a floor for the stock's value. Therefore, buying stock above this price near the end of the experiment could result in a loss if the stock cannot be sold at a higher price before the final round.

In summary, my reflections from the practice rounds highlight the importance of adjusting limit orders to be more competitive, closely monitoring market reactions to dividend announcements, and maintaining a strategic balance between cash and stock. These insights will guide my strategy adjustments in the upcoming experimental rounds to maximize my total earnings.
