During the practice rounds, I observed the market dynamics and tested initial strategies. Starting with a market price of 14.5 in Round 1, which was slightly above the buyback price of 14, I chose to hold my shares and monitor the market without trading. This decision was based on the potential for dividend earnings and the fact that the market price was not significantly above the buyback price. In Round 2, I attempted to buy an additional share at a price of 13, which was below the market price of 15, but the order was not executed, indicating a lack of sellers at that price. By Round 3, I had increased my share count to 5, likely due to a strategic decision to buy at a favorable price, though the exact transaction details are not provided in the data. My cash balance fluctuated due to interest and dividend earnings, ending at 105.46 with a stock value of 75 at the current market price of 15.

Key insights from these rounds include the importance of understanding market liquidity and the impact of dividend and interest earnings on my portfolio. The market price has been hovering above the buyback price, suggesting that holding onto shares could be beneficial if the price continues to rise. However, the risk of buying at a price significantly above the buyback price near the end of the experiment needs to be managed carefully.

For future rounds, I will continue to monitor price trends closely and adjust my trading strategy based on market conditions. I plan to maintain a balance between cash and stocks to benefit from both interest and dividend earnings. I will also refine my price forecasting based on observed trends to potentially earn additional cash rewards. The practice rounds have shown that patience and strategic timing are crucial in this trading environment.
