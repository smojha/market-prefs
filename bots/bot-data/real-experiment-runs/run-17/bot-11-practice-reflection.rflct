During the practice rounds, I observed that the market prices fluctuated between 14.5 and 15.0, with no trades executed in the first round and only one in the second, indicating a cautious approach among participants. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 was not competitive enough to execute trades, suggesting a need to adjust limit prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trades. The importance of the final buyback price of 14.0 per share became clear, especially as it influences decisions towards the end of the experiment. I should aim to buy stocks below this price and sell above it to maximize returns. My cash balance increased due to dividends and interest, which reinforces the strategy of maintaining a balance between cash and stocks to leverage both income sources. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for potential forecast winnings. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends closely, adjust my order prices to be more competitive, and keep an eye on the approaching buyback value to optimize my trading decisions. Additionally, I will consider the behavior of other participants and adapt my strategies as market dynamics evolve.
