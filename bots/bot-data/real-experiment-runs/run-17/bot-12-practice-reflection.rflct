During the practice rounds, I observed a gradual increase in the market price of the stock, moving from 14.5 to 15.0, which suggests a potential upward trend. My initial strategy of submitting a conservative buy order at 14.0 in the first round was not filled, indicating a lack of liquidity or a higher reservation price among other participants. However, adjusting my buy order to 15.0 in the second round resulted in a successful purchase, increasing my stock holdings to 5 shares. This experience has taught me the importance of testing market liquidity and being willing to adjust my price to cross the spread when necessary.

The dividends and interest earned during these rounds are significant. In Round 1, I earned a dividend of 1.6 and interest of 5.0, and in Round 2, a dividend of 2.0 and interest of 4.58. These earnings highlight the value of holding both cash and stock, as they contribute to my total earnings.

Looking ahead to the main experiment, I need to consider the buyback price of 14 at the end of the 30 rounds. With the current market price at 15, buying more shares at this price could be risky, as I might incur a loss if I cannot sell them at a higher price before the end of the experiment. Therefore, I should be cautious about overpaying for stocks as we approach the final rounds.

My price forecasting during the practice rounds was generally accurate, with forecasts being within the 2.5-unit range of the actual prices. This suggests that I have a reasonable understanding of the market's direction, which can be leveraged in the main experiment to earn additional cash rewards.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, adjusting my buy and sell orders based on observed trends and liquidity. I will also keep a close eye on the frequency of high and low dividends to refine my strategy further. If the market price stabilizes or shows a clear upward trend, I may consider increasing my stock holdings, but always with the end-of-experiment buyback price in mind. Additionally, I will continue to make informed price forecasts to maximize my earnings from this aspect of the experiment.
