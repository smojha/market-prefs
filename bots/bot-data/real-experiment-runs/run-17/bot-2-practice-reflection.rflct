During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, suggesting a stable market environment. My strategy of setting limit orders at 13 to buy and 15 to sell did not result in any trades, indicating that the market was cautious and possibly waiting for more significant price movements. The lack of executed trades aligns with my insight from the INSIGHTS.txt that the market might require more aggressive trading to stimulate activity.

I noted that my cash increased steadily due to the 5% interest and dividends from stocks, which supports the strategy of holding onto stocks and cash as a viable approach. However, the market price ending at 15 in the last practice round, above the buyback price, suggests potential for capital gains if I can sell at these higher prices before the end of the experiment.

My price forecasts were slightly off, which indicates a need for refinement in predicting future market movements. I will need to use these forecasts more effectively to adjust my trading strategy, aiming to buy low and sell high while keeping the buyback price in mind.

For the main experiment, I plan to start with more aggressive limit orders to test the market's willingness to trade. I will also consider selling stocks if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price to maximize earnings before the automatic conversion at the end. Monitoring market trends and adjusting strategies based on real-time data and forecasts will be crucial to adapt to changing market dynamics.
