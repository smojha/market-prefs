During the practice rounds, I observed several key dynamics and strategies that will inform my approach in the main experiment. Initially, the market appeared less liquid than anticipated, as evidenced by no executed trades in the first round despite submitting buy and sell orders. This suggests that more aggressive trading strategies might be necessary to execute trades effectively. The market price slightly increased from 14.5 to 15.0 over the practice rounds, indicating a potential bullish trend, which I should consider in my future trading and forecasting decisions.

My cash balance increased from 106.6 to 120.81 over the practice rounds, primarily due to dividends and interest earnings. Holding stocks provided dividends of 1.6 per round, and cash earned a 5% interest rate, which underscores the importance of balancing my portfolio between stocks and cash. The dividends and interest rates play a crucial role in my total earnings, and I plan to continue monitoring their impact.

In terms of price forecasting, my forecasts were not accurate enough to earn the rewards, indicating a need for refinement. I will focus on recent market trends and potential future volatility to improve my forecasts.

For the upcoming main experiment, I will adjust my trading strategy to be more aggressive, experiment with different order quantities to understand their impact on market price movements, and refine my forecasting based on observed trends. The current market price of 15 per share is above the buyback price of 14, so I will be cautious about buying stocks at this price as it approaches the end of the experiment. I aim to maximize my total earnings by carefully managing my portfolio and adapting my strategies as market dynamics evolve.
