During the experiment, my strategy was rooted in maintaining strong cash reserves to leverage the consistent interest earnings while engaging in strategic buying and selling near the trade-in value of 14 per share towards the end of the trading periods. This approach proved effective in preserving capital and generating steady cash flow through both dividends and interest. My cautious trading approach, reflected in my decision to avoid engaging in a pump-and-dump strategy, allowed me to secure predictable returns from both stock and cash interest despite the market dynamism. Maintaining a balance between stock holdings and cash reserves turned out to be particularly beneficial as it kept my financial position flexible and resistant to market volatility caused by speculative trading actions. An important takeaway from this experiment is the effectiveness of aligning trades closer to intrinsic values and leveraging predictable income sources, such as dividends and interest, which provided a good hedge against market uncertainties. This experiment has enhanced my understanding of market psychology and the benefits of patient, value-oriented investment strategies in ensuring stability and maximizing earnings potential.
