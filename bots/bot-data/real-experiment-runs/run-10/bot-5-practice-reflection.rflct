Reflecting on the practice rounds, it is clear that my strategy of placing orders moderately away from the market price resulted in no trades being executed. This highlights the importance of submitting order prices closer to the current market price to increase trade execution probability. Observations suggest that aligning buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price, while ensuring they remain competitive, can help in capturing market opportunities more effectively. Additionally, given the consistent market price of 14.5 over the periods, it indicates a level of stability, although forecasts should remain adaptable to possible future fluctuations. Furthermore, the dividends and interest play an important role in accumulating cash, emphasizing a balanced approach between investing in shares and holding cash. For the final rounds, the focus should be on maximizing returns through strategic buying and selling while keeping a close watch on market trends and other participantsâ€™ behaviors for enhanced decision-making.
