During the practice rounds, I've observed that maintaining a conservative approach with slight deviations from the market price did not result in any executed trades. My strategy to set buy orders slightly below the market price and sell orders above did not yield actionable outcomes since the market price remained stable at 14.5 across two rounds with no volume, indicating a lack of transaction activity or aggressive price changes by other participants. This stability suggests that initial market conditions have limited trading opportunities if strategies remain too conservative when the market itself is not dynamic. Recognizing the trade-in value of 14 as a ceiling for future purchases near the experiment's end is crucial, as buying at a higher price would negate any anticipated gains from dividends or market conditions. Additionally, enhancing forecast accuracy remains important for increasing final cash earnings. The focus for future rounds should shift towards active observation to better understand potentially vital price movements or patterns created by other participants and adjusting strategies dynamically accordingly. Future plans can also consider splitting strategies â€” a part can remain conservative for stability, while another portion can leverage brief market volatility for opportunities when they present themselves. Furthermore, maintaining a strong cash position facilitates both investment in stock during opportune moments and safeguarding the potential risk associated with overleveraging in stock holdings. The balance between maximizing dividends and retaining cash should remain a priority as conditions evolve throughout the experiment.
