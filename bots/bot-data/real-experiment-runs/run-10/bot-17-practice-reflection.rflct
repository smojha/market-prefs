During the practice rounds, I noticed that my orders did not get executed, primarily due to the cautious positioning of buy orders below the market price and sell orders above it. This resulted in a lack of trade activity, so I missed out on potential market movements and dividends. For future rounds, I will consider positioning orders closer to the market price while still ensuring a margin for profit over the conversion value. Balancing between maximizing dividends and interest returns, while ensuring enough liquidity for strategic trades, remains crucial. Additionally, I need to improve my forecast accuracy to earn additional cash rewards. Observing market trends could assist in making more informed buy/sell decisions and price predictions. Focusing on adaptive strategies based on market volatility and participant behavior will be critical to enhancing my overall earnings by the end of the experiment.
