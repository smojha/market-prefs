During the practice rounds, I observed that my limit orders for buying and selling stock did not execute. Setting buy orders at or slightly below recent market prices could increase the chances of execution, while sell orders might need to be slightly above to catch price fluctuations. Forecasts for future prices need more consideration of the dividend variability and its potential impact on price. I will explore historical patterns and possibly adjust my forecasts based on how dividends might influence market demand and supply. Additionally, as we get closer to the 30th round, the terminal value of stocks should guide buying decisions, since any purchase above the trade-in value of 14 could lead to a loss if shares cannot be sold at a profit before conversion. Adapting to market conditions while leveraging dividend-generated cash incrementally could optimize returns.
