Throughout this trading experiment, my strategy focused on achieving a stable and secure profit rather than engaging in high-risk market manipulation tactics. My approach was conservative, leveraging dividend earnings and interest gained from cash holdings while minimizing the risk of losses from volatile market decisions. I prioritized selling stocks at or above the market price and buying at or below the trading value to secure steady gains over time. Predicting market trends and placing strategic orders became crucial, especially as the trading periods advanced and the conversion price loomed as a critical factor to consider. This taught me the importance of maintaining a balanced portfolio that adapts to market conditions while ensuring a protective margin for cash reserves. While the hypothetical strategy of pumping and dumping could inflate earnings, it also projects increased risk and potential legal concerns outside the scope of this experiment. I learned the value of patience, timely decision-making, and risk management, essential traits that I will carry forward in real-world trading scenarios. Moreover, keeping detailed logs of insights and plans allowed for consistent learning and adjustment of strategies, reinforcing a disciplined approach to trading.
