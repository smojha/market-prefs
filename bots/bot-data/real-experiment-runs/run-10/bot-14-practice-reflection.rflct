Reflecting on my practice experience, I have observed that while my initial buy and sell limit orders were set strategically to maximize potential gains, they have not resulted in any executed trades thus far. This indicates that my orders may not have been competitive enough given the market dynamics. The adjustments to slightly increase the buy order and decrease the sell order in the second practice round suggest a need to be more aggressive or adaptive with my order pricing strategy. Additionally, the consistency in market prices across rounds reveals a stable trend in the current practice setting, but it remains crucial to remain vigilant for any market shifts. Analyzing the overall trend and expected dividends has reinforced the significance of balancing between holding cash (for interest) and stock (for dividends). A key takeaway is that I might need to place more emphasis on the high dividend periods to accumulate cash effectively while also trying to engage more with the market to foster more active trading. My future versions of trading should aim to set buy orders closer to or even slightly above probable market prices and sell orders just within the expected market range to ensure trades are executed while still retaining profitability. The price forecasting aspect should also be revisited, carefully considering market fluctuations and historical data to improve accuracy and gain additional cash rewards. Lastly, continual monitoring of market conditions is paramount, and adjustments should be timely to adapt to any observed volatility as the practice phase progresses to the real experiment phase.
