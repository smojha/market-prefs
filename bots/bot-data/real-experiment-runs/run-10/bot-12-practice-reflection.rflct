During the practice rounds, I observed that my orders were not executed, indicating that my buy/sell price ranges might have been outside of the market dynamics at play. Notably, the market price remained stable, which might have required more aggressive or flexible trading strategies to achieve execution. This reflects the necessity to adapt and potentially adjust my limit prices closer to market prices, while still maintaining room for profitability from dividends and eventual stock trade-in value at 14. Additionally, having consistent interest earnings from cash balances provides a predictable income stream. For the upcoming rounds, it will be essential to monitor market conditions actively and adjust strategies accordingly. Managing forecasts to fall within the required accuracy range could provide additional cash rewards, serving as another earnings stream.
