In the practice rounds, it became clear that a cautious approach is necessary, especially considering the conversion value of 14 per share at the experiment's end. Although my buy and sell orders in the first two practice rounds did not execute due to pricing, keeping my buy orders just below the market price ensures potential for acquisition without exceeding the conversion risk. This practice ensures not paying more than the known end value while seeking buy executions. Conversely, placing sell orders above this threshold protects against selling at a loss or for no gain. This dynamic requires constant recalibration with market forecasts and behavior. The consistent market price of 14.0 suggests a potential misalignment in prediction variation and an opportunity to refine forecastingâ€”factor in stability and possible slight fluctuations. Overall, aligning strategies closer to actual market outcomes while maintaining foresight for market changes is needed to enhance execution possibilities and forecasting rewards. A more profound understanding and adaptation to market influences will be crucial in optimizing the trading approach across the experiment rounds.
