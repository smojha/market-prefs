During the practice rounds, I observed that my strategy of placing buy orders below the market price and sell orders above the market price led to no executed trades. This suggests that either the spread set between my buy and sell orders was too wide or the market wasn't as volatile as expected. A necessary adjustment may be to place buy orders closer to or even at the market price when trends indicate stability, while still maintaining a margin to ensure gains if stocks are sold later. The current market price of 14 aligns with the stock trade-in value, indicating limited potential for capital gains but consistent dividend income can still be beneficial. Maintaining a balance between holding stocks for dividends and cash for interest is crucial, especially since the dividend yield can vary each round. Forecasts have not yet been beneficial due to stagnant price movement, so ongoing market analysis to refine predictions and observe others' trading behaviors could enhance accuracy. In the future, focusing on shorter timeframe forecasts to adjust for immediate expectations might be prioritized, as they have greater immediate impact on strategy. Overall, refining my order strategy with more dynamic pricing aligned with market conditions is key. Additionally, considering liquidity in later periods will be crucial to avoiding unsold stocks above the buyback rate of 14. As of now, maintaining and possibly increasing my stock holding when the market price dips below 14 is advisable with continued monitoring.
