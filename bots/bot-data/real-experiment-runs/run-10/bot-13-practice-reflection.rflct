In the practice rounds, the market's reluctance to trade resulted in no executed trades for both buying and selling orders. This highlights the importance of adjusting the buy and sell limits to better match market conditions. The initial strategy of buying aggressively below 13 and selling above 15 may need to be re-evaluated, as setting the buy orders slightly above the buyback price or selling closer to the market price might be necessary to facilitate trades. Moreover, despite the lack of executed trades, owning 4 shares of stock has consistently provided dividends, adding to overall cash balance. Forecasting accuracy remains critical; refined prediction techniques for estimating market price fluctuations over different periods could enhance cash rewards. Going forward, balancing between accumulating cash through dividends and interest with strategic stock trades will be vital to optimizing returns. Additionally, leveraging the fixed buyback price of 14 suggests avoiding purchases above this unless compensated by dividends or projected market price increases can justify the higher investment. Finally, reviewing the market dynamics each round will be essential for adapting strategies and making informed decisions to maximize earnings by the end of the experimental rounds.
