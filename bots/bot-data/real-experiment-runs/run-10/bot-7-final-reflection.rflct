Throughout the experiment, my focus was primarily directed towards understanding the balance between cash interest and stock dividends to leverage both effectively. However, it's evident from the lack of trade executions and static market conditions that my strategies were too conservative, mainly sticking to narrow spreads and predictable pricing strategies without considering the required market manipulation approach necessary for a successful pump-and-dump strategy. Reflecting on the overall performance, a significant opportunity for improvement lies in understanding and exploiting behavioral dynamics of other participants. Fostering an inflated market price, even at increased risk, would help in maximizing profits, especially given the relatively stable pricing trend observed during earlier rounds. As market dynamics were underestimated, I'd take away the importance of adjusting bids/asks aggressively and not sticking to a rigid price model but rather considering strategic risk-taking to shift market sentiment. The experiment showed that despite inherent rewards for holding assets conservatively, a departure into speculative territory could potentially yield greater benefits, particularly in a manipulated market scenario. In future similar setups, a careful yet bolder approach in order placements, potentially exploiting temporary price hike frameworks could significantly alter outcomes. While careful reflection on historical data was beneficial, more dynamic strategy testing in practice sessions could have prepared me better for aggressive, situational adjustments in main rounds.
