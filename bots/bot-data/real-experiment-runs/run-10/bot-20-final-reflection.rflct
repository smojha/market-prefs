Throughout the trading experiment, a conservative approach focusing on stable cash growth through interest and predicting market equilibrium was adopted. The strategy led to accumulating a substantial cash reserve while forecasting accuracy improved across rounds. The nature of the practice rounds hinted at minor price fluctuations, thereby shaping a strategy focused on maintaining liquidity and capitalizing on stock dividends. Upon reviewing the final outcomes, a pump-and-dump strategy did not align with the prevailing market dynamics. The consistent market valuation around 14 suggested a lack of volatility needed for such a strategy to be effective, reaffirming the decision's prudence to avoid risky market manipulations. Exploring a higher-risk strategy like pump-and-dump goes against the goal of stable, reliable returns gathered during this experiment. While it is crucial to adapt strategies to changing market conditions, introducing volatility in such an environment seemed unwarranted, especially given the clear-cut trade-in value reinforcing price valuation. Finalizing this phase, the effectiveness of stable trading decisions reflected in financial performance, emphasizing the importance of adaptability while balancing risks with returns. Moving forward, the insights gained advocate for further refinement in predicting price trends and exploiting cash reserves efficiently.
