Throughout the experiment, I maintained a focus on minimizing risk by aligning buy and sell strategies with the STOCK's buyback value, ensuring that I did not pay more for STOCK than the final conversion price. My approach was to consistently place BUY orders below the current market prices and SELL orders at a slightly higher price, effectively limiting exposure while attempting to accrue dividends and interest steadily. The consistent market price of 14 to 15 during most rounds provided a stable environment, allowing interest earnings on CASH to grow unimpeded. The strategy of maintaining a balance between STOCK and CASH proved effective, as reflected in the final payout. Furthermore, my ability to forecast future prices within a reasonable margin justified additional bonuses for accurate forecasts. Adapting to market conditions where volume and predictability were low required patience but ultimately reinforced the strategy of leveraging market stability and CASH interest instead of inflating market prices artificially. In future iterations, recognizing conditions for executing a pump-and-dump strategy could prove beneficial, particularly when anticipating irrational market behavior or exploiting other participants' missteps. However, in this scenario, the preservation and incremental growth of resources offered a sustainable and lower-risk approach toward maximizing end value.
