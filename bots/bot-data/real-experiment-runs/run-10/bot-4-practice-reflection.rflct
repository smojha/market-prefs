During the practice rounds, I observed that my submitted buy and sell orders were not executed, potentially due to the price points chosen. The market price remained at 14.5, close to the buyback price of 14. This suggests a cautious market atmosphere among participants, possibly due to the limited stock value increase opportunity given the end-of-round conversion cap. My forecasting efforts need refinement, as my predictions didn't completely align with the actual prices, although they were close. Going forward, it would be beneficial to place buy orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution, particularly as the stock buyback price remains a critical threshold. Additionally, understanding market participants' behaviors and price-setting tendencies could provide strategic advantages. Maintaining a balance between cash retention for interest accumulation and strategic stock acquisitions will be crucial in maximizing overall earnings. Further experimentation with more competitive order pricing is necessary to improve trade execution rates.
