During the practice rounds, I've observed that the market tends to be quite stable, as indicated by the lack of executed trades and consistent market prices around 14.5 and 14. It seems other participants may be placing similar buy and sell orders, causing no movement in stocks. My focus on buying stocks around their conversion value of 14 has been validated by the stability in prices; however, my buy orders at 14.0 have not been executed possibly due to the market price not dipping below 14.5. This indicates a need to broaden buying parameters slightly above the conversion value to gain opportunities in stock purchases. Additionally, placing sell orders at 16.0 yielded no trades, suggesting that others are possibly valuing stocks below this, aligning with the real trade-in value. I should consider lowering the sell limit to just above my purchase price to enable trade execution. Forecast accuracy needs improvement as none were verified due to lack of price movement. This reflection signifies the importance of understanding peers' pricing patterns and adjusting strategies dynamically. Ensuring we're flexible with our pricing strategies while leveraging forecast earnings can optimize returns. In future rounds, continued monitoring of market trends and aggressive adaptation of pricing strategies will be crucial for maximizing earnings.
