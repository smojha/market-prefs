Reflecting on the practices, the lack of executed trades indicates a need for more competitive pricing within orders. I aimed to place buy orders below market prices and sell orders just above, based on perceived patterns, but failed to consider tighter spreads conducive to actual trades. Moving forward, I'll analyze market trends with more focus on market sentiment changes influenced by dividend payouts and broader price movements. While maintaining caution with buy and sell orders near market prices, I'll also explore crossing the spread cautiously when necessary. Forecasting needs adjustment too, as accuracy within 2.5 units is crucial for additional rewards. Adjusting order prices based on evolving market dynamics and improving forecasts could enhance potential rewards significantly by the end of the experiment.
