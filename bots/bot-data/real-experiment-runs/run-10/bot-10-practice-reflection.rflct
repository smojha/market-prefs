During the practice rounds, I learned the importance of aligning my buy and sell orders more closely with the market price to increase the chances of execution. My initial strategy of setting conservative prices resulted in no executed trades, which highlighted the need for more aggressive price adjustments. Additionally, I noticed the significance of monitoring my cash and stock balances to maintain the flexibility needed for future buying or selling opportunities. I also recognized the importance of price forecasting, as accurate predictions could lead to additional earnings. Going forward, I need to strike a balance between securing profits through dividends and interest while being mindful of the final trade-in value of the stock. This balance will require constant adaptation to market dynamics and a willingness to adjust my strategies as needed.
