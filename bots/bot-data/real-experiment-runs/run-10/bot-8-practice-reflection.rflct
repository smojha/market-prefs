During the practice rounds, I maintained my initial strategy of setting a threshold for selling stock only if its price exceeded 16, focusing on potential dividends and future price appreciation. Observing no executed trades, I realized the importance of being flexible with order prices to better align with market dynamics. My forecasts, although not realized in executed trades, provide a benchmark for future predictions. The lack of market volume indicates a limited trading environment where adjusting order thresholds slightly closer to previous market prices might be necessary for execution. I learned not to overcommit to maintaining stock if there's a viable opportunity to capitalize on small price differences between market and buyback prices before Round 30. Flexibility and timely order adjustments are crucial for optimizing returns from dividends and market volatility.
