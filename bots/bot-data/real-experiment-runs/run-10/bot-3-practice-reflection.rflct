During the practice rounds, I observed that the market activity was low, as evidenced by the lack of executed trades despite submitting buy and sell orders. This indicates that patience and timing are crucial in this experiment. I noticed that my price forecasts were close to the actual market prices, suggesting that my initial forecasting approach might be on the right track. However, I need to be more flexible with pricing to increase the probability of executing trades, potentially even crossing the spread slightly when expecting market changes. I should also continue to monitor dividends as they might influence stock prices, providing opportunities to buy low or sell high. Lastly, since stock trade-in value at the end of the experiment is 14, I should be cautious in buying stocks at prices that do not present a clear opportunity for reselling at a profit or ensuring adequate dividends and calculated stock price appreciation. Going forward, refining my forecast accuracy and exploiting market pricing discrepancies when they arise will be key strategies for maximizing earnings.
