During the practice rounds, I realized that while holding stocks provides consistent dividend earnings, actively engaging in the market by placing competitive limit orders is crucial for maximizing potential gains. My strategy of placing sell orders close to market prices and buy orders slightly below did not lead to executed trades, likely due to insufficient aggressive pricing. Moving forward, I recognize that adjusting my order prices to align more closely with market conditions is essential. The importance of forecasting correctly also became evident, as accurate predictions can significantly boost end-of-experiment earnings. Furthermore, considering the end-of-game stock trade-in value, prioritizing trades that result in stock buy prices below this threshold is critical. I need to remain flexible and responsive to changing market conditions while being cautious of the ending stock conversion price. Overall, this reflection has highlighted the need for a balanced approach involving dividends, competitive trade execution, and precise forecasting for optimizing earnings.
