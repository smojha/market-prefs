Through the practice rounds, I've gained valuable insights into the dynamics of trading in this experimental environment. One key observation is the importance of setting realistic limit prices to ensure order execution, as multiple unfilled orders indicate strong competition at certain price points. In practice rounds 1 and 2, my submitted order prices did not align well with market conditions, leading to no trades being executed. To enhance trading success, I will re-evaluate my strategy and consider being more flexible with limit prices, potentially by accepting a narrower margin to increase the likelihood of order execution. Additionally, my forecasts were not aligned with market behavior, thus I need to refine my prediction model using more recent data and short-term trends to improve accuracy. Dividends also provide a steady income, reinforcing the need to balance between holding stock for dividends and holding cash for interest. Lastly, I will closely monitor the market to promptly adapt strategies when unexpected changes occur. Keeping a close eye on market trends and competitors' behavior is crucial for success in the main experiment.
