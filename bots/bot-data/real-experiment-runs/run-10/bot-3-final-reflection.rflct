Throughout this trading experiment, my strategy focused on prudent management of assets to secure consistent returns, and I opted not to pursue a manipulative pump-and-dump strategy given ethical considerations and experimental constraints. I concentrated on maximizing dividends and interest by maintaining a balanced portfolio of stock and cash, placing cautious and realistic buy/sell orders, and aiming for forecasts as close to the actual market prices as possible. A key insight was that as the rounds progressed, cash reserves grew significantly due to compounded interest, bolstering overall returns. Additionally, understanding equilibrium prices and predicting market trends based on prior rounds proved essential, particularly when liquidating stocks as the game neared its end. While I could have engaged in more aggressive trading, maintaining steady cash flow and asset stability yielded satisfactory results. Future strategies might explore alterative tactics like exploiting higher volatility periods, provided such actions align with the experiment's ethical guidelines and personal investment values. Reflecting on my experience, focusing on logical, data-driven decision-making and understanding experiment mechanics above attempts to control market prices led to a positive financial outcome.
