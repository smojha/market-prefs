Reflecting on the practice rounds, it's clear that a key strategy should involve closely aligning buy and sell orders with the last known market price while factoring in the buyback value of 14. During both practice rounds, no trades were executed because the orders were not optimally set. In future rounds, I should aim to place buy orders slightly above the market price of 14 if the intrinsic value seems favorable, and sell orders just above the market price to execute trades more effectively. 

The forecasting strategy seems on track, as it's important to keep predictions within a reasonable range based on market history to earn forecast rewards. Additionally, maintaining a balance between keeping cash liquid for interest gains and being ready to capture buying opportunities is crucial. 

In summary, the focus should be on setting realistic and strategic order prices, enhancing forecast accuracy to gain additional rewards, and balancing stock holdings to capitalize on both dividend income and cash interest.
