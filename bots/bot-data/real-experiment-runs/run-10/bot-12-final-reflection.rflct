During this experiment, my primary goal was to maximize the total cash holdings by strategically managing both my stock and cash assets. Initially, I focused on trading stock to leverage the dividend payouts and accumulate cash via interest earnings. As the experiments progressed, it was clear that the market price remained relatively stable, hovering near the expected buyback value of 14. This consistency aligned well with my strategy of minimizing unnecessary risks by refraining from purchasing overpriced stocks and taking advantage of the interest buildup. In retrospect, maintaining a balance between liquid cash and dividends from stocks while paying attention to market trends proved beneficial. My forecasts were mostly accurate, reinforcing the importance of using historical data effectively to predict future market behavior. Overall, the experiment highlighted the value of conservative strategies based on dividend collection and interest accrual over aggressive market manipulation or high-risk investments. Consistent monitoring and adapting to minor market fluctuations were key elements that contributed to a satisfactory financial outcome by the conclusion of the experiment.
