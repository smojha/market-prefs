During the practice rounds, I noticed that my buy and sell orders did not execute. This suggests that my pricing strategy might not have been competitive enough to match the market conditions. It's important to refine the balance between buying stocks low and selling high while accounting for the dividends and interest that come into play. A key insight is that stocks could carry a higher speculative value due to dividends, but I must be cautious particularly as the rounds approach the end, where the liquidation value of 14 per stock may limit potential returns if the stock price doesn't exceed this amount. It seems prudent to hover my buy orders slightly above recent market prices and my sell orders slightly below my expected future market price to improve the likelihood of execution. Additionally, I must continuously monitor market dynamics and adjust my strategies accordingly. Also, considering the conversion rate at the end of the experiment and the impact of dividends throughout, an informed decision must be made about whether it's worth buying additional stocks at their current prices or holding onto cash for consistent interest returns. In future rounds, maintaining liquidity and ensuring the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions will be crucial to maximize earnings.
