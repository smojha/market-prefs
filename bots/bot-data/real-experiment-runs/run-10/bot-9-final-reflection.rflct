Reflecting on the completed experiment, the primary strategy was to maintain a steady accumulation of dividends and interest while building up a cash reserve for potential trades. Throughout the rounds, a cautious approach was employed, with an emphasis on holding shares due to the guaranteed liquidation value of 14 cash per stock at the end. This strategy provided a safety net against market volatility. Attempting a 'pump-and-dump' strategy would require a high-risk play, focusing on driving the price up through significant buy orders and biased forecasting, followed by selling off at the inflated peak. However, executing such a strategy in this controlled environment, with constraints like fixed dividends and liquidation prices, would necessitate extensive market influence and liquidity, which may not have been feasible given the setup and participant behavior. Ultimately, the key insights gained included the importance of dividends and compounding interest, alongside the understanding that liquidation value sets a cap on end-game stock prices. As such, maintaining a balanced approach towards liquidity and stock ownership appeared to be more pragmatic in optimizing returns under the given experiment conditions.
