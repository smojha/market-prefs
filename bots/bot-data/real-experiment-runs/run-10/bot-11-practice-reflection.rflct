During the practice rounds, my strategy focused on buying stocks at a lower price range (12-14) and selling them when the price was above (15-17). However, the lack of executed trades indicates potential issues with order prices perhaps not being aggressive enough to get filled. Adjusting my strategy to accommodate tighter buy/sell spreads might improve trade execution. Additionally, maintaining a balance between stock and cash ensures consistent earnings from both dividends and interest. Accurately forecasting market prices can substantially enhance earnings, given the forecast reward structure, so I must enhance my predictive accuracy. Considering the fixed trade-in value of 14 for stocks, I need to be cautious when the market price nears this level as buying above it may result in losses if I can't sell at a higher price before the end. Going forward, staying adaptable to market dynamics and iteratively refining my approach based on ongoing portfolio performance and market conditions will be crucial. Overall, maximizing earnings involves a symbiotic use of strategic trading, stock holdings, interest accrual, and accurate price forecasting.
