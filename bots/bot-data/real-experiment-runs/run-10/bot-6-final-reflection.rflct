Throughout the experiment, I maintained a conservative trading strategy, setting both buy and sell limit orders close to the market's observed price of 15.0 and later 14.0. This reflects my adherence to risk management and the challenging nature of significantly shifting the market given other subjects' actions. The persistence of prices near the conversion value demonstrated a strong equilibrium state, likely due to the predictable final cash conversion, making it difficult to induce larger market movements. As the chosen strategy was centered around this stability, it largely forewent speculative tactics like pump-and-dump that rely on greater volatility, which I found risky given the observed market behavior. 

One key insight was the consistently narrow range where the buy and sell orders were effective, hinting at a somewhat efficient market with rational actors mindful of the stock's fundamental value near the trade-in rate. Future strategies might focus on predicting infrequent but potentially exploitable deviations from this pattern, although the inherent risk seems substantial given the information provided.

If I were to incorporate a more aggressive strategy, known to be highly risky and potentially unethical like a pump-and-dump, it would likely require coordinated effort or significantly altered market conditions to succeed. Absent evidence of sufficient price manipulation potential, my reflection supports sticking with more predictable value-based strategies to ensure steady growth through dividends and interest, unless clear speculative opportunities appear.
