During the practice rounds, I observed that more aggressive limit prices helped in executing trades, as seen in Practice Round 2 where I successfully bought 2 shares. The market price increased from 14.5 to 15.0 and then to 16.0, indicating a potential upward trend. My forecasts were mostly accurate, particularly for the immediate next round, suggesting that short-term predictions might be more reliable. Holding stocks has been beneficial due to dividends, but I need to be cautious of the buyback value of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment. Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring market dynamics, adjusting my limit prices to ensure trades are executed, and refining my forecasting strategy to maximize additional earnings. It's crucial to balance the portfolio and consider the trade-in value of stocks as the rounds progress.
