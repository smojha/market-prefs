During the practice rounds, I adopted a conservative approach to understand the market dynamics better. My orders to buy and sell were cautious, with prices set slightly below and above the market price, respectively. This approach allowed me to observe market behavior without risking significant losses. However, no trades were executed in the first two rounds, indicating that the market prices did not reach my order prices. This suggests that I might need to adjust my order prices to be more competitive. Additionally, my price forecasts were close to the actual prices, but not always within the reward threshold. I need to refine my forecasting strategy to improve accuracy. Key insights include the importance of monitoring market prices and volumes, adjusting order prices based on market trends, and refining forecasting strategies. For the main experiment, I plan to continue with a conservative approach initially but will be more adaptive to market conditions and willing to adjust my order prices and forecasts more dynamically.
