During the practice rounds, I noticed that my orders were not being executed due to conservative limit prices. The market price increased from 14.5 to 16.0, indicating a potential upward trend. My forecasts were mostly conservative and inaccurate, missing out on potential rewards. For the main experiment, I plan to: 1) Be more aggressive with limit prices to ensure trades are executed; 2) Pay close attention to market trends to improve forecast accuracy; 3) Consider the trade-in value of 14.00 per share when making buying decisions; 4) Diversify my portfolio to manage risk and return; and 5) Adapt my strategies based on market dynamics to maximize total earnings.
