During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price can indeed fluctuate significantly. My initial strategy of submitting conservative buy and sell orders did not result in any executed trades. For future rounds, I plan to be more aggressive with my orders and adjust them based on the observed market behavior. Additionally, I need to be more strategic with my price forecasting to improve accuracy and earn the forecast reward. Holding stock for dividends is beneficial, but I must be cautious not to overpay, especially as the experiment nears its end. Adaptability and close monitoring of the market will be key to maximizing earnings.
