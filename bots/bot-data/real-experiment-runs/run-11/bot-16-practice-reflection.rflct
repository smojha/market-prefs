During the practice rounds, I observed the following: 

1. **Market Price Trends**: The market price increased from 14.5 to 16.0 over the two rounds, indicating a potential upward trend. However, it's crucial to remember the buyback price of 14, which could influence future market prices. 

2. **Order Strategy**: My initial strategy of placing buy and sell orders close to the market price did not result in any executed trades. This suggests I may need to adjust my prices more aggressively or consider the market volume and other participants' behaviors. 

3. **Dividend Impact**: The dividend earnings were significant, especially in round 2 where the dividend was high (1.0 per share). This reinforces the insight that holding stock can be more beneficial than holding cash due to the higher expected dividend. 

4. **Forecasting**: My price forecasts were conservative and did not accurately predict the market price movements. I need to consider the market trends and other participants' behaviors more carefully in future forecasts. 

5. **Cash Management**: My cash increased steadily due to interest and dividend earnings. However, I need to be more active in trading to maximize my earnings. 

**Plans for Improvement**: 
- Be more aggressive in adjusting buy and sell order prices to increase the likelihood of executed trades. 
- Pay closer attention to market volume and other participants' behaviors to inform my trading strategy. 
- Consider the buyback price and the potential for the market price to revert to this level when making trading decisions. 
- Be more thoughtful in my price forecasts, considering market trends and dynamics. 
- Explore different strategies for holding and trading stock to maximize dividend earnings while managing the risk of the buyback price.
