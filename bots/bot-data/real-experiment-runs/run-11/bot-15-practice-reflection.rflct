During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock has been relatively stable but slightly increasing. In the first round, there were no executed trades, indicating a cautious market. In the second round, the market price increased to 15.0, and the volume was 3, suggesting some trading activity. My buy and sell orders were not executed, which could mean that my price points were not competitive enough. The dividends earned were consistent with the probability of low or high dividends, and the interest earned on cash was as expected at 5% per period. My forecasts were conservative but close to the actual market prices, which is a positive sign. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my orders to be more competitive and continue to forecast conservatively. Balancing cash for interest and stock for dividends remains crucial. I will also consider the buyback price of 14 per share when making buying decisions, especially as the experiment nears its end.
