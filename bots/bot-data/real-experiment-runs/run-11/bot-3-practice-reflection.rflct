During the practice rounds, I learned several important points that will guide my strategy in the main experiment:

1. **Market Dynamics**: The market was relatively illiquid in the first round, with no trades executed. This suggests that patience and observation are crucial in the early stages. As the rounds progressed, the market became more active, indicating that participants were adjusting their strategies.

2. **Order Strategy**: Submitting both buy and sell orders helped me test the market and gather information. Diversifying orders at different price points can provide better insights into market sentiment.

3. **Buyback Price**: The buyback price of 14 is a critical reference point. Buying stocks below this price ensures that I do not incur losses at the end of the experiment. It's important to be cautious about buying stocks at prices significantly higher than the buyback price, especially as the experiment nears its conclusion.

4. **Forecasting**: My price forecasts were somewhat accurate, but there is room for improvement. Monitoring market trends and adjusting forecasts accordingly will be important. Accurate forecasts can provide additional cash rewards, which will be beneficial.

5. **Cash Management**: Managing cash effectively is crucial. The 5% interest rate provides a steady return, but it is important to balance between holding cash for interest and using it to buy stocks for dividends.

6. **Adaptability**: The market conditions can change rapidly, so being adaptable and ready to adjust strategies is essential. For example, in the second round, I successfully sold a stock at 15, which was a good decision given the market price trend.

Moving forward, I will continue to test the market with diverse orders, monitor market activity closely, and make strategic buy and sell decisions to maximize my earnings. Additionally, I will focus on improving my price forecasts to increase my chances of earning additional cash rewards.
