Throughout the experiment, I aimed to maximize earnings by adapting strategies based on market conditions. Initially, I focused on buying stock at lower prices and selling at higher prices to capitalize on price fluctuations. As the rounds progressed, I observed a stabilization in market prices around 12.0, indicating participants' awareness of the approaching end. This insight led me to prioritize holding cash and avoiding new stock purchases, given the buyback price of 14.0. Accurate forecasting played a crucial role in earning additional cash, which was essential for my overall strategy. In the final rounds, I successfully sold most of my stock, aligning with the strategy to hold cash and avoid the risk of stock being terminated at a value lower than the market price. The experiment highlighted the importance of adaptability and accurate forecasting in maximizing earnings.
