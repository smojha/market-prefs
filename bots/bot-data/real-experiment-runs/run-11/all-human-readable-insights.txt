2. Observe the market dynamics and dividend payments.
3. Experiment with different limit prices to understand market behavior.
4. Aim to maintain a balanced portfolio of cash and stocks to maximize earnings.
ðŸ”¸ Insights: Given the equal probability of low and high dividends, the expected dividend per stock is (0.4 + 1.0) / 2 = 0.7 cash per period.
