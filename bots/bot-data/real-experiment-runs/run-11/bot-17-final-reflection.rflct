Throughout the experiment, I aimed to maximize my cash reserves through interest earnings and accurate price forecasts. Initially, I focused on selling my stocks as the market price increased, which allowed me to accumulate a significant amount of cash. By round 9, I had sold all my stocks and continued to forecast market prices accurately, earning additional cash rewards. However, towards the end of the experiment, the market price stabilized around 12, and I avoided buying stocks as the market price was below the buyback price of 14. I successfully managed to keep my cash reserves high and made strategic trades to further increase my earnings. My final cash amount was 707.96, which, combined with my participation fee and bonuses, resulted in a total payment of $15.60. In future experiments, I would continue to prioritize maximizing cash reserves and accurate forecasting, while being cautious about buying stocks when the market price is close to the buyback price.
