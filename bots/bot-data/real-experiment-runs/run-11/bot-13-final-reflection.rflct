The experiment was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of strategic planning and adaptability in trading. My initial strategy of liquidating stocks by round 26 proved effective, as it allowed me to focus on accurate price forecasting, which became crucial for earning additional rewards. The market showed stability at 12, and this stability helped in making informed forecasts. However, I missed out on some potential gains by not attempting to manipulate the market price through a pump-and-dump strategy. This strategy could have significantly increased my earnings by inflating the market price far above the assetâ€™s fundamental value and then selling at the peak. In future rounds, I would consider being more aggressive in my trading approach, particularly in the earlier stages, to maximize profits. Additionally, focusing on forecasting accuracy and understanding market dynamics were key to my success. Overall, the experiment provided a comprehensive understanding of trading dynamics and the importance of strategic decision-making.
