In the first two practice rounds, I noticed that the market price fluctuated slightly around the initial forecasts. My strategy of submitting limit orders close to the market price resulted in one successful trade in the second round, where I sold a share at 15.0. This increased my cash holdings significantly, highlighting the importance of competitive pricing. The dividend payouts and interest earnings also contributed to my cash increase, emphasizing the need to balance both stock and cash holdings. For the upcoming practice round, I plan to continue adjusting my limit prices based on market trends and dividend expectations. I will also forecast prices more conservatively, aiming to stay within the 2.5 unit range for accuracy. Additionally, I will consider the buyback price of 14 per share when deciding on buy orders, especially as the experiment progresses. Overall, adaptability and careful observation of market dynamics will be key to maximizing earnings.
