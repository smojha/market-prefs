During the experiment, the primary strategy was to maintain a conservative approach and focus on accurate price forecasting to maximize earnings. This strategy involved avoiding new stock purchases to preserve the current cash reserve, which proved effective in the early rounds. However, the latter part of the experiment saw a shift towards more aggressive trading, particularly as the market price fluctuated significantly. The decision to sell all remaining shares in the final rounds was crucial in securing a substantial cash reserve by the end of the experiment.

Key insights from the experiment include the importance of accurate forecasting, which provided additional cash rewards, and the strategic timing of trades to capitalize on market fluctuations. The practice rounds were instrumental in developing a cautious approach, which was refined as the experiment progressed. The final outcome, with a total payment of $15.34, highlights the success of the conservative strategy combined with well-timed aggressive trades.

Looking ahead, it would be beneficial to continue refining the forecasting techniques and explore more dynamic trading strategies to adapt to changing market conditions. Additionally, considering the pump-and-dump strategy, future experiments could focus on manipulating market sentiment to drive up the price before executing strategic sells at peak values. This approach could potentially maximize profits by creating a market bubble and profiting from its collapse.
