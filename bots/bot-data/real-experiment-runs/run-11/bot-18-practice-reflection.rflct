The practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of strategic planning. Here are my key takeaways: 

1. **Market Dynamics**: The initial rounds showed a cautious market with limited trading activity. The market price fluctuated slightly, but the volume remained low, indicating that participants are still feeling out the market. 

2. **Order Submission Strategy**: My attempts to buy and sell shares at modest prices did not result in executed trades. This suggests that I may need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to ensure my orders are filled. 

3. **Dividend and Interest**: The dividends and interest earned are crucial for long-term earnings. It is essential to balance the holding of cash for interest and stocks for dividends. 

4. **Forecasting**: Accurate forecasting can be a significant source of additional earnings. My conservative predictions were close to the actual market prices, indicating that this approach is effective. 

5. **End-of-Experiment Considerations**: The buyback price of 14 is a critical consideration. As the experiment nears its end, it will be important to avoid buying shares at prices significantly higher than the buyback value unless there is a high likelihood of selling them before the final round. 

**Future Strategies**: 
- Continue to monitor market dynamics and adapt trading strategies accordingly. 
- Be more aggressive in crossing the spread to ensure orders are filled. 
- Maintain a balance between holding cash for interest and stocks for dividends. 
- Continue with conservative price forecasts to maximize additional earnings. 
- Keep the buyback price in mind and adjust strategies as the experiment progresses. 

These insights and strategies will guide my decisions in the main experiment to maximize total earnings.
