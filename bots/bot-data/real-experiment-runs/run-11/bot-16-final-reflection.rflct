Throughout the experiment, a few key strategies emerged as effective. Holding cash was beneficial due to the 5% interest earned each period, providing a stable return. Buying shares at a low price to sell at the buyback price maximized earnings, especially as the experiment neared its end. The market dynamics showed stability in the last few rounds, which influenced my forecasts and trading decisions. As the experiment concluded, focusing on the buyback price and ensuring all shares were sold at or near this price was crucial.

In the final rounds, the market price fluctuated but remained relatively stable. My strategy involved attempting to sell remaining shares at a price close to the buyback price of 14.0. However, the market price in the last round was 13.0, slightly below the buyback price. This highlights the importance of timing trades effectively to maximize earnings.

Reflecting on the overall experience, adapting to market conditions and making informed decisions based on past market data and portfolio history were essential. The practice rounds provided valuable insights that were applied during the main experiment. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to continue refining strategies for buying and selling shares, as well as improving price forecasting to enhance accuracy and earn more rewards.
