During the practice rounds, I observed that the market was relatively stable with prices close to the buyback price. In Round 1, no trades were executed, suggesting a cautious market. In Round 2, the market price increased slightly to 15.0, but still, no trades were executed, indicating that my order prices might not have been competitive enough. My current strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio of cash and stock seems viable, but I need to adjust my BUY and SELL orders to be more competitive. For the next rounds, I plan to: 1. Adjust my BUY orders to be closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. 2. Continue monitoring market feedback and adapt my strategies accordingly. 3. Be mindful of the proximity to the buyback price, especially as the experiment progresses, to avoid buying stock at a price higher than the buyback value. 4. Keep a balanced portfolio to maximize earnings through both dividends and interest. Additionally, my price forecasts were reasonably accurate, but I need to continue refining my predictions to earn more cash rewards.
