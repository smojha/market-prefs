During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly but generally hovered around the initial forecasted price of 14. My buy and sell orders were not executed, which suggests that the market conditions were either stable or that other participants were being cautious. The dividend earnings and interest accrued as expected, contributing to my cash reserves. For future rounds, I plan to continue experimenting with tighter limit prices and smaller trades to better understand market dynamics. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting strategy based on the observed market trends and dividend patterns. Keeping an eye on the approaching buyback price of 14 per share will be crucial as the experiment progresses.
