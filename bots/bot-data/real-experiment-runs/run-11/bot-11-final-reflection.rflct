Throughout the experiment, several key strategies and insights were developed and refined. The initial strategy focused on maximizing cash holdings through interest earnings while avoiding new stock purchases, especially as the experiment neared its end. This approach proved effective, particularly in the later rounds where the market stabilized at 12.0 for several periods. Adaptability was crucial, as market dynamics could change rapidly. Accurate price forecasting was another critical component, earning additional cash rewards and helping to anticipate market movements. By the final rounds, the strategy shifted towards liquidating stock holdings to maximize cash, which was ultimately converted at a favorable rate. Overall, the combination of careful cash management, strategic selling, and accurate forecasting contributed to a successful outcome.
