During the practice rounds, I observed that the market was relatively stable with prices hovering around 14 to 16. I attempted to buy stock at 14 to maximize dividend gains while minimizing risk, but my orders were not executed, likely due to the market price being slightly higher. My forecasts were generally accurate, but I need to adjust them more dynamically based on real-time market trends. For future rounds, I plan to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to ensure order execution and will consider selling stock if the price significantly exceeds the terminal value of 14. Balancing stock for dividends and cash for interest remains crucial, and I will continue to monitor market dynamics closely.
