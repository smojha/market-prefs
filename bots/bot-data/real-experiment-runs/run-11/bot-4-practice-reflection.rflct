During the practice rounds, I observed several key points that will be crucial for maximizing earnings in the main experiment. Firstly, the market price fluctuated around 14, which aligns with the stock trade-in value. This suggests that conservative forecasting and strategic order placement are essential. I tested the market by submitting buy and sell orders close to the current market price, and I noticed that the market responded positively to reasonable orders. Buying low and selling high worked well in practice, but I need to be more aggressive in buying when the market price is significantly below the trade-in value and selling when it's above. The forecasting feature helped in predicting future market prices, which can be a valuable tool for adjusting strategies. However, I need to be more accurate in my forecasts to earn the rewards. Adapting strategies based on market responses and being cautious about the market price nearing the end of the experiment are crucial. Overall, the practice rounds provided a good foundation for understanding market dynamics and refining my trading approach for the main experiment.
