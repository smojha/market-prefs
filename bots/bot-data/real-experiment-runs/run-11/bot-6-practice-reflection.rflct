During the practice rounds, I noticed that the market price fluctuated between 14.5 and 16.0. My buy and sell orders were not executed, indicating that my price points were not competitive enough. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my orders to be more aggressive, especially when the market price is close to the buyback price of 14.00. I should consider buying stock at prices below 14 to maximize earnings at the end of the experiment. Additionally, monitoring dividend payouts and adapting my strategy to balance cash and stock holdings will be crucial. My forecasts were relatively accurate but could be improved by considering market trends and dynamics more closely. Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of adaptive strategies.
