During the practice rounds, I aimed to increase my stock holdings to benefit from dividend earnings, while also attempting to buy stock at prices below the market price of 14 to ensure a margin of safety. However, my buy orders did not execute as the market price remained above my bid prices. This indicates that the market was relatively stable but inactive, suggesting that more aggressive buying strategies might be necessary to stimulate trading activity. Additionally, the dividend payments are a significant source of earnings, so increasing stock holdings could be beneficial. For the next rounds, I will consider adjusting my buy orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. I will also monitor the market price to potentially sell some stock if the price rises significantly, allowing me to lock in profits. Forecasting market prices has been challenging, and I will continue to refine my predictions based on market trends and dividend payouts.
