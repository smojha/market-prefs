During the practice rounds, I attempted a conservative approach by submitting BUY and SELL orders close to the market price. However, no trades were executed in the first two rounds, indicating that the market might be cautious or my orders were too far from the market price. This suggests a need to adjust orders based on market feedback and possibly experiment with more aggressive pricing to trigger trades. The dividends and interest earned contributed positively to my cash holdings, emphasizing the importance of monitoring these factors. Price forecasting proved challenging, as my predictions were static and did not account for market fluctuations. For future rounds, I plan to be more dynamic in my price forecasting to improve accuracy within the 2.5 units range and earn additional rewards. Overall, the practice rounds highlighted the need for adaptability and strategic adjustments based on real-time market conditions.
