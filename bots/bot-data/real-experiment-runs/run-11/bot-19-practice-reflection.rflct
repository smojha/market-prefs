During the practice rounds, I observed the following key points:

1. Market Liquidity: There was limited market activity, with no executed trades in the first two rounds despite submitting buy and sell orders. This suggests that the market might be less liquid, and it could be challenging to get orders filled, especially if the spread is wide.

2. Price Movements: The market price increased from 14.5 to 16.0 over two rounds, indicating potential upward momentum. However, it's crucial to remember that the stock's buyback value is 14, which should anchor pricing strategies, especially as the experiment progresses.

3. Dividend Impact: The dividend earned varied from 1.6 to 4.0, significantly impacting the stock's value. Monitoring and forecasting dividends will be essential for making informed trading decisions.

4. Order Strategy: My orders were not executed, suggesting that I might need to adjust my prices to be more competitive relative to other participants' orders. It may be necessary to cross the spread to get orders filled.

5. Forecasting: My price forecasts were relatively accurate for the immediate next round but less so for future rounds. I need to improve my forecasting strategy to earn more forecasting rewards.

For the main experiment, I plan to:
- Be more aggressive in order pricing to increase the likelihood of order execution.
- Closely monitor dividends and adjust my trading strategy accordingly.
- Consider the stock's buyback value when making buying decisions, especially in later rounds.
- Improve my forecasting strategy to maximize rewards.
