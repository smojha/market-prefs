Throughout the experiment, I aimed to maximize my earnings by strategically buying and selling stocks while forecasting market prices accurately. Initially, I observed a stable market price around 14-15, which allowed me to establish a baseline for my trading decisions. As the rounds progressed, I noticed an upward trend in market prices, peaking around round 10 with prices reaching 20. This trend provided opportunities to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the market's volatility. However, the market began to stabilize around 12.0 in the later rounds, indicating a potential bubble burst. My strategy shifted to selling off stocks to avoid losses and maximize cash holdings. By the final round, I had successfully liquidated all my stocks, ending with a significant cash balance of 546.64. My accurate forecasts, especially in the later rounds, contributed to additional earnings through forecast bonuses. Overall, the key to success was adapting to market dynamics, timing trades effectively, and maintaining a conservative approach towards the end to secure profits.
