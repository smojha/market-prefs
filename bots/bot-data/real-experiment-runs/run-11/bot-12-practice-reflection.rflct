During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 14.5 and 16.0. My initial strategy of buying at lower prices (e.g., 13 or 14) and selling at higher prices (e.g., 15 or 16) did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market may be more conservative than anticipated. The market price seems to hover around the stock's trade-in value of 14.00, with slight fluctuations. This indicates that participants are aware of the stock's eventual conversion value and are pricing it accordingly. 

Given the current portfolio and market price, it might be prudent to adjust the buying and selling prices closer to the observed market prices. For example, attempting to buy at 14.5 or 15.0 and sell at 16.0 or slightly higher. Additionally, considering the interest earned on cash, it may be beneficial to hold more cash if trading opportunities are limited. 

For price forecasting, I noticed that my predictions were close to the actual prices, but not always within the reward threshold of 2.5 units. I should continue to adjust my forecasts based on observed trends and market dynamics. 

Moving forward, I will aim to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to ensure trades are executed, especially when the market price is above the trade-in value. It's crucial to adapt to the market's conservatism and adjust strategies accordingly to maximize earnings.
