During the practice rounds, I tested the market by submitting competitive buy and sell orders. I aimed to acquire additional shares and adjust my forecasting strategy based on the observed market dynamics. Here are some key observations and insights:

1. **Market Volatility**: The market price can fluctuate significantly even with low trading volumes. This was evident in the shift from 14.5 to 15.0 and then to 16.0 over three rounds, despite minimal executed trades.

2. **Order Strategy**: My orders to buy at 14.0 and sell at 15.0 were not executed, suggesting that the market might be more competitive than initially anticipated. Adjusting the spread between buy and sell prices could increase the likelihood of executed trades.

3. **Forecasting**: My price forecasts were conservative and did not always align with the actual market price. It's essential to be more flexible and responsive to market trends when making future forecasts.

4. **Cash Management**: Holding cash for interest earnings is crucial, but it's also important to invest in stock for dividend earnings. Balancing these two aspects will be key to maximizing overall earnings.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**: Considering the current market price of 16.0 and the buyback price of 14.0, it's prudent to be cautious about buying more stock at high prices, especially as the experiment nears its end. Focusing on selling at a premium and reinvesting in stock when the price is closer to the buyback value could be a more effective strategy.

6. **Reflection Value**: The practice rounds have been valuable in understanding market dynamics and refining strategies. Future rounds will require adaptability and careful planning to maximize earnings.

Overall, the practice rounds provided a safe environment to experiment with different strategies. Adjusting the bidding strategy and being more responsive to market trends will be crucial moving forward.
