Throughout the experiment, I adopted a conservative strategy focused on maintaining cash holdings and accurate price forecasting to maximize rewards. Initially, I avoided purchasing additional shares once the market price stabilized near the buyback price of 14.0. This strategy proved effective as the market price did not rise significantly above this level in the latter rounds. By the end of the experiment, I had successfully converted all my shares to cash and maintained a significant cash balance.

Key insights from the experience include the importance of accurate price forecasting, which allowed me to earn additional rewards. Maintaining a high cash balance also proved valuable, especially when the market price fluctuated. The interest earned on cash holdings provided a steady income stream, which was crucial for maintaining liquidity.

In future rounds, I would recommend continuing to focus on accurate forecasting and conservative cash management. However, if the market conditions change dramatically, it might be worth considering more aggressive buying and selling strategies to take advantage of potential price swings. Overall, the strategy of conserving cash and focusing on forecasting rewards was effective and should be considered for future experiments.
