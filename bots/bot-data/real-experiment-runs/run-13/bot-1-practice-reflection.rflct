During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price was relatively stable and close to the buyback price of 14. This indicates that participants are cautious and prefer to trade near this price. My initial buy and sell orders were not executed, possibly because they were not aggressive enough. For the final practice round, I will adjust my orders to be closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. Additionally, my price forecasts were conservative and within the acceptable range, but I will consider the market's stability and adjust my forecasts accordingly. This strategy will help me better understand the market dynamics and prepare for the main experiment rounds.
