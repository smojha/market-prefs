During the practice rounds, I tested the market by submitting both buy and sell orders. I aimed to buy at a price below the market price and sell above it, but no trades were executed, indicating that my orders were not competitive enough. The market price stabilized around the buyback price of 14, which is a critical reference point. It's important to consider the trade-in value of 14 per share when making decisions, especially as the experiment nears its end. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my orders to be more competitive and actively engage with the market dynamics. I will also focus on balancing my portfolio to maximize dividend earnings while maintaining a healthy cash reserve for interest and future purchases. Additionally, I will be more strategic with my price forecasts to increase the likelihood of earning rewards.
