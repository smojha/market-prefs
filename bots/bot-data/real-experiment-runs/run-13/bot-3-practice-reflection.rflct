During the practice rounds, I observed that the market activity was low, and none of my orders were executed. This suggests that more aggressive pricing might be necessary to complete trades. The market price has been relatively stable around 14.5, which is slightly above the stock trade-in value of 14.00. This indicates that buying stock at prices significantly above 14 might not be profitable in the long run, especially as the experiment nears its end. 

Key insights from the practice rounds:
- **Aggressive Pricing**: More competitive pricing is needed to execute trades. I should consider lowering my buy orders and raising my sell orders to increase the likelihood of trades.
- **Dividend Impact**: Dividends can significantly boost earnings, making it beneficial to hold stock. The dividend earned in the second round (4.0) was higher than the first round (1.6), demonstrating the potential variability in dividend earnings.
- **Interest Reliability**: The steady interest on cash provides a reliable return, making it a safe option when market conditions are uncertain.

For the main experiment, I plan to:
- Continue testing more aggressive buy and sell orders to increase trading activity.
- Monitor dividend earnings closely to inform stock holding strategies.
- Be mindful of the stock trade-in value and adjust buying strategies accordingly, especially as the experiment progresses.
- Use insights from practice rounds to adapt and refine strategies for maximizing total earnings.
