During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price was relatively stable around 14.5. However, none of my BUY or SELL orders were executed, suggesting that my limit prices might not have been aggressive enough. I need to consider adjusting my limit prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of executing trades. Balancing between holding stocks for dividends and maintaining liquidity for future trades is crucial. The final buyback price of 14 CASH per stock should influence my BUY decisions, especially as the experiment nears its end. I will continue testing the market by submitting both BUY and SELL orders and monitor market price changes to adapt my strategies accordingly.
