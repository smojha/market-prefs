During the practice rounds, I tested conservative buy and sell orders to understand the market dynamics without risking too much cash or stock. The market price remained relatively stable at 14.5, and no trades were executed, which suggests that the market might be cautious or that other participants are also testing their strategies. The dividend payouts varied between 0.4 and 1.0, highlighting the importance of monitoring these payouts to adjust future strategies. Maintaining a balance between cash and stock is crucial to maximize earnings from both interest and dividends. The forecasts were consistent but need refinement based on actual market behavior. Adapting strategies and being flexible with price forecasts will be key moving forward.
