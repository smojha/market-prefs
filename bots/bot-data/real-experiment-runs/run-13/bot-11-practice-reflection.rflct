During the practice rounds, I noticed that my initial limit orders were too conservative and did not result in any executed trades. The market price remained relatively stable at 14.5, but my orders were not competitive enough to be filled. For future rounds, I need to be more aggressive with my bids and asks to ensure participation in the market. Additionally, I observed that my price forecasts were too static and did not account for potential market fluctuations. I should consider the dividend earnings and interest rates more carefully to balance my portfolio effectively. In the next rounds, I plan to test more varied limit prices and adjust my forecasts dynamically based on market trends.
