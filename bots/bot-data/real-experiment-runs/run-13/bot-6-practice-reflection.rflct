During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price has remained relatively stable, hovering around the buyback price of 14. This suggests that other participants may also be cautious and are likely aware of the final buyback value. My initial strategy of placing conservative buy and sell orders did not result in any executed trades, indicating that I need to be more competitive with my limit prices. The lack of market volume also suggests that participants are hesitant to trade at current prices.

Moving forward, I plan to:
1. Adjust my buy orders to be more competitive, potentially increasing my bid prices slightly above 13 while still aiming to buy below the buyback price of 14.
2. Lower my sell order prices to encourage trades, as long as they remain profitable.
3. Continue to monitor market trends and adjust my forecasts accordingly.
4. Maintain a balance between holding cash for interest and buying stocks for dividends to maximize overall earnings.

Additionally, I will keep in mind the final buyback value and avoid buying stocks at prices significantly above 14 as the experiment nears its end.
