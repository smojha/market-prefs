During the practice rounds, I observed that the market was relatively stable with no executed trades, indicating that my buy and sell orders were not competitive enough. The market price remained around 14.5, and the dividends significantly impacted my cash holdings. My strategy of submitting orders close to the last market price did not yield any trades, suggesting that I need to be more aggressive in narrowing the spread between buy and sell orders. Additionally, the dividend payments of 0.4 and 1.0 per share highlight the importance of holding stock for potential high dividends. However, the fixed interest rate of 5% on cash provides a steady return, making it crucial to maintain a balanced portfolio. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my orders to be more competitive and continue to monitor market dynamics closely to maximize earnings.
