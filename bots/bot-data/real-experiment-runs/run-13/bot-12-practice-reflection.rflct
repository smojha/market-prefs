During the practice rounds, the market price for the stock remained stable around 14.5, which is slightly above the buyback price of 14. No trades were executed, indicating a cautious market where participants were likely observing and testing strategies without making significant moves. My conservative strategy of placing limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 did not yield any trades, but it did provide valuable insights. The absence of trades suggests that other participants were also cautious and not willing to cross the spread. The dividends earned were either 0.4 or 1.0, and the interest on cash provided a steady 5% return each period. The price forecasts were consistent with the market price, suggesting that the market is valuing the stock close to its buyback price. Moving forward, I plan to continue with a conservative approach, focusing on buying stocks at or below the buyback price of 14 to maximize earnings at the end of the experiment. Adapting to market dynamics and being prepared to adjust strategies based on observed trends will be crucial.
