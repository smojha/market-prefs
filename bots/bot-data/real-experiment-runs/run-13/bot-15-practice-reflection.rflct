During the practice rounds, I attempted to buy stock below the buyback price of 14 to capitalize on the guaranteed buyback value. However, none of my buy orders were executed, indicating that the market price remained above my bid prices. The market price stabilized around 14.5, slightly above the buyback price, suggesting that other participants might also be aware of the buyback value and are unwilling to sell below this price. The dividend earnings varied between 0.4 and 1.0 per share, significantly impacting the overall value of holding stock. Monitoring dividends closely is crucial for future trading decisions. Additionally, the 5% interest on cash provides a steady return, making it important to balance the portfolio between cash and stock. For the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue aiming for buying stock below 14 while closely monitoring market dynamics and adjusting my strategy accordingly. I will also consider the potential impact of dividends and interest on my portfolio value.
