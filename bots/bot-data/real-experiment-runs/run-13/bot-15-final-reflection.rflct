Throughout the experiment, I employed a strategic approach to maximize my earnings by leveraging market dynamics and the guaranteed buyback price of 14 per share. Initially, I focused on buying shares at prices below the buyback value, particularly when the market price stabilized around 13. This strategy allowed me to accumulate shares at a discount, aiming to benefit from the guaranteed buyback at the end of the experiment. However, as the rounds progressed, I noticed that the market price began to fluctuate, and there were opportunities to sell shares at a premium. This led me to adjust my strategy, selling shares when the market price was higher than the buyback price and buying back when it dropped below 14. This adaptive approach helped me capitalize on short-term price movements while maintaining a safety net with the buyback price. Additionally, I submitted price forecasts to earn the forecast bonus, which further boosted my earnings. Overall, this strategy of balancing buying at low prices and selling at high prices, combined with accurate price forecasting, resulted in a significant increase in my cash holdings and a successful outcome in the experiment.
