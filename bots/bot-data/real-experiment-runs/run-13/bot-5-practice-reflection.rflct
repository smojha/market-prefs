During the practice rounds, I observed a stable market with minimal fluctuations in price. My initial orders to buy and sell at slightly varied prices did not result in any executed trades, which suggests a cautious market environment. The dividends earned were consistent with the given probabilities, and the interest on cash holdings provided steady growth. The forecasts I made were close to the actual market prices, indicating a predictable pattern in the short term. For the main experiment, I plan to continue with conservative buying and selling orders while closely monitoring the dividend earnings and adjusting my strategy as needed. Balancing cash holdings for interest with stock holdings for dividends will be crucial, and I will aim to make more informed forecasts to maximize my earnings.
