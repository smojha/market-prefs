Throughout the experiment, my strategy evolved significantly. Initially, I focused on conservative trading to build cash reserves, which allowed me to capitalize on later opportunities. The forecasting rewards were a consistent source of additional cash, reinforcing the importance of accurate predictions. As the experiment progressed, I observed a clear trend of the market price decreasing towards the buyback price of 14, indicating participants were liquidating their shares to avoid being terminated at a lower price. This insight led me to adopt a more aggressive selling strategy in the later rounds, successfully liquidating all my shares by round 27. In the final rounds, I avoided further trades to retain all cash, ensuring maximum payout. The experiment highlighted the importance of adaptability and the value of accurate forecasting in maximizing earnings.
