Throughout the experiment, I attempted to maximize my earnings by strategically trading stocks and forecasting market prices. In the early rounds, I focused on buying stocks at relatively low prices and selling them at higher prices to profit from the price differences. As the rounds progressed, I noticed that the market price fluctuated significantly, which allowed for opportunities to buy low and sell high. However, as the experiment neared its end, I shifted my strategy to focus more on accurate price forecasting to earn additional cash. This shift was particularly important given the fixed conversion rate of 14 CASH per share at the end of the experiment. By the final round, I had sold all my shares and accumulated a significant amount of cash, which maximized my earnings. The practice reflection helped me understand the importance of strategic planning and adapting to market conditions. Overall, this experience highlighted the value of careful planning and forecasting in maximizing earnings in a trading environment.
