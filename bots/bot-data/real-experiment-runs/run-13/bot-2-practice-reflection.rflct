During the practice rounds, I observed that my orders were not executed, indicating that my price points were not competitive enough. The market price remained relatively stable at 14.5, and there were no executed trades. This suggests that either other participants were not submitting orders or the spread between buy and sell orders was too wide. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my order prices to be more competitive and potentially cross the spread to ensure trades are executed. Additionally, I will continue to make conservative price forecasts and focus on small, strategic trades. As the experiment progresses, especially towards the end, I will be mindful of the buyback price of 14 and avoid buying shares at significantly higher prices. Overall, understanding market dynamics and adapting strategies will be crucial for maximizing earnings.
