Throughout the experiment, my strategy evolved to maximize earnings by leveraging market dynamics and forecasting accurately. Initially, I aimed to buy stock at lower prices and sell at higher prices, but as the experiment progressed, I realized the importance of holding cash to earn interest and timing my stock purchases and sales strategically. The market showed volatility, and I observed that the price tended to stabilize around the buyback price of 14.0 as the experiment neared its end. This insight was crucial in my decision-making process.

In the final rounds, I focused on liquidating my stock holdings to maximize cash, knowing that each stock would be converted to 14 cash units at the end. This strategy ensured that I did not hold onto stock that would be worth less than the market price. Additionally, accurate forecasting provided additional rewards, enhancing my overall earnings.

Reflecting on the experiment, I recognize the importance of adaptability and strategic planning. Balancing between holding cash and investing in stock, along with accurate forecasting, was key to my success. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies to maximize earnings in similar trading environments.
