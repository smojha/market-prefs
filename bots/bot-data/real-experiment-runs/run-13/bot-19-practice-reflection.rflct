During the practice rounds, I observed that my initial limit prices for buy and sell orders were too narrow, which resulted in no executed trades. This highlights the importance of being more flexible with limit prices to better match market conditions. Additionally, my price forecasts were cautious and did not fully account for the potential impact of dividends on future stock prices. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my limit prices more dynamically based on observed market prices and volumes. I will also be more aggressive in my price forecasting, taking into consideration the potential for higher dividends and market sentiment. It's crucial to maintain a balance between holding cash for interest earnings and investing in stock for dividend earnings, especially considering the stock trade-in value at the end of the experiment.
