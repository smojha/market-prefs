During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. My strategy of submitting limit orders to buy at 14 and sell at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market was not highly active or that other participants were also cautious. The dividends earned varied between 0.4 and 1.0, and holding cash provided a steady 5% return. My forecasts were conservative and close to the actual market prices, which is a positive sign for future forecasting tasks. Moving forward, I plan to continue being cautious with my trades, focusing on buying stocks at or below the buyback price of 14, and adapting my strategy based on market dynamics. It's crucial to balance stock ownership with cash holdings to maximize earnings through both dividends and interest.
