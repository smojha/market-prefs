During the practice rounds, I noticed that my buy orders were not being executed despite being close to the market price. This indicates that the market might be more competitive than initially anticipated. It is essential to adjust my bidding strategy to ensure that some trades are executed. I plan to incrementally increase my buy order prices while still ensuring they remain below the buyback price of 14. Additionally, I need to be more flexible with my forecasts, as the market price can vary more than expected. Moving forward, I will consider the current market trends and adjust my forecasts accordingly. It is also crucial to monitor the dividend payments closely, as they significantly impact overall earnings. Lastly, as the market price is currently above the buyback price, I should be cautious about buying more stocks unless I am confident I can sell them before the end of the experiment.
