During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the STOCK remained relatively stable around 14.5. My initial buy and sell orders did not execute, indicating that my price points were not competitive enough. I will need to be more aggressive in my pricing to ensure that my orders are filled. Additionally, my price forecasts were generally conservative, which could be adjusted to better align with the observed market trends. In future rounds, I will aim to set more realistic and competitive prices for both buying and selling, and I will refine my forecasts to better reflect the market dynamics. It's crucial to adapt quickly to market conditions and maximize both trading and forecasting earnings.
