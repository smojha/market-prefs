Throughout the experiment, I initially focused on maintaining a balanced portfolio by holding cash and earning interest. However, as the market price stabilized around 13, I realized that holding more stock became unnecessary. My strategy shifted towards holding cash, especially since stocks would be converted to 14 CASH per share at the end of the experiment. This conservative approach allowed me to accumulate a significant amount of cash by the final round. 

In terms of price forecasting, I made conservative predictions, especially for the final rounds, which helped me earn a forecast bonus. My final portfolio at the end of round 30 consisted of 680.32 CASH, with no shares owned. This approach ensured that I maximized my earnings from interest and avoided the risk of holding stocks that might not sell at a higher price. 

Reflecting on the experiment, the key insights were to focus on earning interest from cash holdings and to make conservative price forecasts. This strategy proved effective in ensuring a stable and considerable payout.
