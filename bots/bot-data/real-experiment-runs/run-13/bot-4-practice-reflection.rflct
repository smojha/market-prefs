During the practice rounds, I focused on conservative trading and observing market behavior. I submitted limit orders to buy and sell shares, but no trades were executed due to the lack of market activity. This allowed me to maintain my initial portfolio while earning dividends and interest. My price forecasting was moderately accurate, with some forecasts being within the reward range. Moving forward, I plan to continue with conservative trading and focus on improving my price forecasts. I will also consider testing the market with small trades to better understand the dynamics and adjust my strategies accordingly. Additionally, I need to be mindful of the stock trade-in value of 14.00 per share when making buying decisions, especially as the rounds progress.
