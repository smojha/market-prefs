During the practice rounds, I maintained a conservative trading strategy by placing buy and sell orders slightly below and above the current market price, respectively. This approach prevented any executed trades, indicating cautious market participation. The market price stabilized around the buyback price of 14, suggesting that participants are aware of the terminal value of the stock. Accurate price forecasting could provide additional cash rewards, which would be beneficial in the long run. For the next practice round, I will continue testing conservative strategies and adjust my forecasts based on observed market behavior. Additionally, I will experiment with different limit prices to better understand market dynamics and focus on improving forecasting accuracy to maximize rewards.
