Throughout the experiment, my strategy evolved based on market conditions and insights gained from previous rounds. Initially, I focused on buying stocks to earn dividends and holding cash to earn interest. However, as the experiment progressed, I realized the importance of accurate price forecasting to earn additional rewards. In the latter rounds, I prioritized selling stocks to maximize cash holdings, especially as the market price approached the buyback price of 14. This strategy allowed me to end the experiment with a significant amount of cash, earning a total payment of $15.48. The key takeaways are the importance of adaptability, accurate forecasting, and strategic trading to maximize earnings.
