Throughout the experiment, my strategy evolved significantly. Initially, I aimed to maximize interest earnings by holding onto cash. However, as the market dynamics became clearer, I shifted towards buying shares when the price was low and selling when the price increased. This approach allowed me to accumulate a larger number of shares and benefit from dividend earnings.

One key insight was the importance of forecasting accurately. By predicting market prices with reasonable accuracy, I earned additional cash bonuses. This helped in making more informed trading decisions and adapting to market trends.

Towards the end of the experiment, I focused on liquidating my shares to maximize cash holdings, especially considering the fixed buyback price of 14 CASH per share. This strategy ensured that I avoided the risk of holding shares that would be converted at a lower value.

In retrospect, a more aggressive buying strategy early on might have yielded higher returns, especially if coupled with accurate forecasting. However, the cautious approach ensured stability and prevented significant losses. Overall, the experiment highlighted the importance of adaptability and accurate forecasting in maximizing earnings.
