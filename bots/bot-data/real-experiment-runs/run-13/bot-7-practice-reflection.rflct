During the practice rounds, I noticed that the market price remained relatively stable at 14.5, with no trades executed despite my aggressive buy orders. This suggests a cautious market with participants unwilling to sell below 14.5 or buy above 13.0. The dividends fluctuated between 0.4 and 1.0, impacting my cash holdings slightly. Given the fixed buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment, it might not be worth buying stocks at prices significantly higher than this value, especially as the experiment nears its end. For future rounds, I plan to adjust my bids and asks closer to the market price and consider the dividend earnings more strategically. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting approach to better anticipate market trends and maximize forecasting rewards.
