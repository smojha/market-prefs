Throughout the experiment, I focused on maintaining a stable cash balance and accurate price forecasting to maximize rewards. Initially, I avoided trades to observe market dynamics and gain insights. The market price showed a downward trend, stabilizing around 13 in the final rounds. My strategy of accurate forecasting proved crucial in earning additional rewards, particularly in the later stages. However, my approach of maintaining cash and avoiding trades early on might have limited my potential earnings from market movements. In future experiments, I plan to be more active in the market, especially in the early rounds, to capitalize on price fluctuations and earn higher dividends. Additionally, I will continue to refine my forecasting skills to ensure consistent rewards. Overall, the experiment was insightful and highlighted the importance of adaptability and strategic planning in trading.
