Reflecting on the trading experiment, I realized several key insights and strategies that could have been more effectively implemented. The market showed significant volatility, which provided both opportunities and challenges. Initially, I aimed to monitor market trends closely and adapt my strategies accordingly. However, the primary goal of maximizing cash by the end of the experiment was not fully realized due to a lack of aggressive trading. 

One critical insight was the importance of accurate price forecasting, which could have earned additional rewards. My predictions were often close but not consistently within the 2.5 units of the actual price. This indicates a need for a more refined forecasting approach, possibly leveraging historical data more effectively. 

In the early rounds, I adopted a conservative approach, focusing on maintaining a stable cash flow. This strategy was safe but did not yield significant gains. As the experiment progressed, I recognized the need to be more proactive in buying and selling shares, especially when the market showed signs of stabilization around certain price points. 

The experiment's design, where each share of STOCK is converted to 14 CASH at the end, highlighted the importance of careful timing in trades. Buying shares at prices significantly above 14 CASH near the end of the experiment would have been detrimental. This realization should have influenced my trading decisions more strongly in the latter rounds. 

In terms of order submission, I noticed that my orders were often not executed due to the spread between buy and sell prices. Crossing the spread to ensure trades might have been more beneficial in certain situations. Additionally, the lack of executed trades in many rounds suggests a need for more aggressive pricing strategies. 

Overall, the experience underscored the importance of adaptability and proactive trading. Future strategies should focus on more aggressive buying and selling, accurate forecasting, and careful timing of trades, especially towards the end of the experiment. By refining these approaches, the potential for maximizing earnings can be significantly enhanced.
