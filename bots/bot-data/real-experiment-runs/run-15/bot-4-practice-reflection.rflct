During the practice rounds, I tested various strategies to understand the dynamics of the market and the impact of my decisions on my portfolio. In the first round, I attempted to buy more stock at the market price but did not execute any trades, which allowed me to earn dividends and interest. In the second round, I tried both buying and selling at different prices, but again, no trades were executed, leading to further accumulation of cash through dividends and interest. Heading into the third practice round, my portfolio consisted of 3 shares of stock and 138.28 units of cash, with the stock valued at 43.5 based on the last round's market price of 14.5.

Key insights from these rounds include the importance of considering the end-of-experiment buyback price of 14 per share when deciding whether to buy or sell. Since the market price in the last round was slightly above the buyback price, it might be beneficial to sell at this price if it is achievable, as it would convert stock into cash at a favorable rate before the automatic conversion at the end of the experiment. However, the potential for high dividends (up to 1.0 per share) also suggests holding onto stock could be advantageous if the market price remains stable or increases.

My strategy moving forward will be to continue monitoring market prices closely and adapt my buying and selling based on whether the market price is above or below the buyback price. I will also consider the potential for dividend earnings against the guaranteed 5% interest from holding cash. If the market price consistently exceeds the buyback price, selling stock might be a prudent strategy to lock in profits. Conversely, if the market price falls below the buyback price, buying more stock could be beneficial, especially if I anticipate a rise in market price or high dividend payouts.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were off by a small margin, which indicates a need for a more refined approach to predicting future market prices. I will aim to improve my forecasting accuracy to earn the additional cash rewards, which could significantly impact my total earnings at the end of the experiment.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into the market dynamics and the impact of my trading decisions. I will apply these lessons to optimize my strategy for the upcoming experimental rounds, focusing on maximizing my total earnings through a balanced approach to stock trading, cash management, and accurate price forecasting.
