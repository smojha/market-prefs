During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly around the buyback price of 14.0, with the highest price reaching 14.5 in round 2. My strategy of attempting to buy at 13.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market is not willing to sell below the buyback price. This indicates that the buyback price is a critical level to monitor for future trading decisions.

The dividends earned from holding stocks were significant, contributing to a steady increase in cash holdings despite no trades being executed. The interest earned on cash, while smaller than potential stock gains, provided a consistent return, reinforcing the importance of considering both stock and cash in portfolio management.

My forecasts were generally accurate, staying within the 2.5 unit margin of the actual market prices. This suggests that my understanding of market trends is developing, which could be beneficial for future rounds.

Moving forward, I will continue to employ a mix of holding and active trading strategies. I will aim to buy stocks below the buyback price and sell above it, while also considering the potential for dividend income. Given the market's reluctance to sell below the buyback price, I may need to adjust my buy orders to be closer to or at the buyback price to ensure execution. Additionally, I will keep a close eye on the market dynamics and adapt my strategies as needed to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
