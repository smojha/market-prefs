During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly between 14.0 and 14.5. This stability influenced the effectiveness of my limit orders, as none of my buy or sell orders were executed. This suggests that my buy and sell thresholds might need to be more closely aligned with the market price to increase the likelihood of trades being executed. The dividends from the stocks varied between rounds, with a high of 4.0 and a low of 1.6 per round, which aligns with the given probabilities. The interest earned on cash was consistent and provided a steady return, which is an important consideration as it competes with the potential gains from stocks.

My strategy of monitoring dividends to understand the average return on stocks is crucial for deciding whether to hold or sell stocks, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where stocks will be converted at 14 cash per share. The 'Buy Low, Sell High' strategy with adjusted thresholds did not result in any trades, indicating a need for more aggressive or adaptive thresholds. The diversification strategy seemed less relevant in the stable market conditions observed, but maintaining a balanced portfolio remains a sound approach.

As we approach round 30, the end-game strategy becomes increasingly important. Buying stocks at prices below 14 becomes a viable tactic to maximize returns upon conversion. My current portfolio with 4 shares and 123.45 cash puts me in a position where I can afford to buy more stocks if the price dips below the conversion rate, which would be beneficial given the current market trends.

Regarding the forecasting task, my predictions were off by a small margin, but close enough to potentially earn rewards if this trend continues. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting model slightly to better predict market movements.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the effectiveness of my trading strategies. Moving forward, I will adjust my strategies to be more responsive to market conditions, particularly as we near the end of the experiment, and continue to refine my forecasting to maximize my total earnings.
