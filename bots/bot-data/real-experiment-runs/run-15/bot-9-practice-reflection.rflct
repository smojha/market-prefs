During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly from 14.0 to 14.5. Despite submitting buy and sell orders, no trades were executed, indicating a cautious approach among participants. This suggests that the market might be waiting for clearer signals or more favorable conditions before engaging in trades. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any trades, suggesting that these prices were not competitive enough to attract counterparties.

In terms of portfolio management, holding onto the stocks yielded dividends of 4.0 in the first round and 1.6 in the second, while my cash balance grew due to a 5% interest rate each period. This balance between the potential dividend income from stocks and the steady growth of cash is crucial. Given that the final buyback price for stocks is set at 14.0, it is important to consider whether purchasing stocks at or above this price near the end of the experiment would be beneficial, especially since the buyback value is guaranteed.

For price forecasting, my predictions were slightly optimistic, expecting gradual increases over time. However, the actual market price movements were minimal, suggesting a need for more conservative forecasts in the future. I will need to refine my forecasting approach to better align with the observed market stability.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to adjust my order prices to be more competitive, potentially setting buy orders closer to the current market price and sell orders slightly above it to increase the likelihood of execution. I will also continue to assess the trade-off between holding stocks for dividends versus keeping cash for interest, especially as the experiment nears its end and the final buyback becomes a more significant factor in decision-making. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting strategy to be more aligned with observed market trends, aiming to maximize my forecast winnings.
