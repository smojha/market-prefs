In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around 14 to 14.5, which aligns with the buyback price at the end of the experiment. This suggests that the market might be anchored to this value, possibly due to participants' awareness of the final conversion rate. My strategy of submitting limit orders slightly above and below the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating a general cautiousness among participants or a lack of significant price movement that would trigger trades at my set limits. This experience has reinforced the importance of closely monitoring market trends and adjusting limit orders to be more competitive if necessary to achieve trade execution.

My portfolio grew steadily due to dividends and interest, which is a positive sign that maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stock can be beneficial. As we approach the actual trading rounds, I will need to be more proactive in adjusting my limit orders to increase the chances of execution, particularly if I observe any shifts in market price trends. Additionally, given the buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment, I will need to be cautious about purchasing stocks at prices significantly above this value, especially as we near the final rounds.

Regarding price forecasting, my predictions were set incrementally higher over time, assuming a slight upward trend. However, the actual market prices did not deviate much from the initial price, suggesting that my forecasting strategy might need to be more conservative and closely tied to the observed market stability. I will refine my forecasting approach in the upcoming rounds to better align with actual market movements.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the need for strategic adjustments in order submission and price forecasting. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on adaptability and a keen awareness of the final buyback price to maximize my earnings.
