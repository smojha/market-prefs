During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly between 14.0 and 14.5, which is close to the trade-in value of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment. This suggests that the market is somewhat efficient in pricing the stock near its intrinsic value based on the final conversion rate. My strategy of selling a share at 14.0 in Round 1 and then attempting to buy back at a lower price was partially successful, as I sold but did not repurchase due to the price not dropping to my limit order of 13.0. This indicates a need for more flexibility in my limit orders to adapt to market conditions more effectively.

The dividends and interest earned provided a steady income, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stocks. The interest rate of 5% on cash is significant and should not be underestimated, as it can compound over the 30 rounds. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for potential forecast winnings at the end of the experiment.

Moving forward, I will adjust my strategy to be more responsive to market price changes. If the market price remains stable or increases slightly, I will hold my current position to continue earning dividends and interest. However, if the price drops below the trade-in value, I will consider buying more shares, as this could be advantageous given the final conversion rate. Additionally, I will continue to refine my forecasting approach, aiming to stay within the 2.5-unit range for accuracy.

Overall, the practice rounds have been valuable in testing initial strategies and understanding market dynamics. I will use these insights to adapt and optimize my approach in the main experiment rounds, focusing on maximizing total earnings by balancing risk and reward.
