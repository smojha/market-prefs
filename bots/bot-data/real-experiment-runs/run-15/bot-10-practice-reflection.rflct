In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with a slight increase to 14.5 in the second round. This suggests a market tendency to stabilize near the buyback value, which is crucial for planning my strategy in the main experiment. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating that other participants were also cautious around these price points. The dividends and interest earned were significant, boosting my cash balance from 100 to 123.45 over the rounds, which underscores the importance of holding stock for dividend income and keeping cash for interest earnings.

Moving forward, I will continue to refine the strategies outlined in PLANS.txt. The 'Hold Strategy' seems viable given the market's stability around 14, but I will also experiment with the 'Buy Low, Sell High' approach by adjusting my buy and sell thresholds more aggressively to capture any market movements. 'Dividend Reinvestment' at or below 14 remains a strong strategy, as it leverages both the dividend payouts and potential price appreciation. As for the 'Endgame Strategy,' I will start planning earlier, possibly selling stocks in the later rounds if the price exceeds 14 to maximize my cash holdings before the final conversion.

My forecasts were conservative, focusing around the stable price of 14, with slight increases projected for later rounds. This approach yielded no rewards yet, so I will consider broader ranges in my future forecasts to increase my chances of earning the forecast reward.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and confirmed the effectiveness of holding stock for dividends and interest on cash. I will use these insights to adapt and refine my strategies throughout the main experiment to maximize my total earnings.
