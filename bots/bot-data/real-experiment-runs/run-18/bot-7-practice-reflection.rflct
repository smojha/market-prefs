During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly around the buyback price of 14, starting at 14.5 and reaching 15 by the end of the third round. My strategy of submitting buy orders below the market price (14.0 and 13.0) did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market was either not liquid enough or that other participants were not willing to sell at those prices. This indicates a need to possibly adjust my buying strategy to be more aggressive if I want to acquire more shares.

The dividends from the stocks and the interest from cash provided steady, albeit small, increments to my cash balance, reinforcing the viability of a balanced portfolio approach. My forecasts were generally conservative, aiming to stay close to the buyback value, which aligns with my strategy to monitor the market closely around this critical threshold.

Moving forward, I plan to maintain a conservative approach but will consider slightly increasing my buy order prices to test market liquidity and possibly secure trades. Additionally, keeping a cash reserve of at least 20% seems prudent to capitalize on any significant price drops. The practice rounds have highlighted the importance of adaptability and the need to closely monitor market dynamics, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where the buyback price becomes more significant.
