During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, which indicates that this price acts as a strong anchor for stock valuation. The lack of executed trades in both rounds suggests that my limit order prices were not competitive enough to engage in transactions. This insight leads me to consider adjusting my limit order strategy to be more aggressive, potentially setting buy orders closer to the market price and sell orders slightly above it to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

The high dividend of 1.0 per share in the first round highlighted the potential benefits of holding stocks, which must be weighed against the 5% interest earned on cash. This balance between dividend earnings and interest income will be crucial in my decision-making process as I move into the main experiment rounds.

My forecasts were slightly off, with the actual market price being higher than my predictions. This suggests that I need to refine my forecasting model, perhaps by considering a wider range of factors influencing market price movements, such as other participants' behavior and potential shifts in market sentiment.

As I approach the main experiment, I plan to utilize the insights gained from these practice rounds to refine my strategies. I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my trading and forecasting approaches based on real-time data and outcomes. The guaranteed buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment will be a key factor in my strategy, especially as I near round 30, where I will aim to maximize my holdings of stock to benefit from this conversion rate. Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable lessons in market dynamics, the importance of competitive pricing in limit orders, and the need for accurate forecasting to maximize earnings.
