During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around 14.5 to 15, which is slightly above the stock's trade-in value of 14. My strategy of attempting to buy at 14 was not executed, indicating a reluctance among participants to sell below the market price. This suggests a potential floor at around 14.5, aligning with my insights from previous rounds. As we approach the end of the experiment, it's crucial to sell stocks when the price significantly exceeds 14 to maximize returns before the automatic conversion. Maintaining a cash reserve has been beneficial, as it not only allows for buying opportunities but also earns a steady 5% interest per period, which adds up over time. My forecasting strategy needs refinement, as I aimed to predict slight increases in price over time, but the market did not move as expected. For the main experiment, I will continue to monitor market trends closely, adjusting my buy and sell orders based on the proximity to the end of the experiment and the current market price relative to the trade-in value. I will also refine my forecasting approach, perhaps considering a more conservative estimate closer to the current market price. The balance between holding cash and investing in stocks remains key, as both avenues offer different but complementary rewards.
