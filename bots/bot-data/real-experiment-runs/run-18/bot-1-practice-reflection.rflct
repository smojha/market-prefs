During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds and slightly increased to 15 in the last round. My strategies of submitting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my limit prices were not competitive enough to influence the market or be filled. This indicates a need to adjust my order submission strategy to be more aligned with the current market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

The conservative strategy of setting buy orders close to the market price and sell orders slightly above it seems appropriate given the stable market conditions observed. However, the aggressive strategy might be necessary to test in the main experiment to see if it can influence the market price or secure more advantageous trades.

Regarding the dividend strategy, holding onto stocks has been beneficial as I earned dividends, which increased my cash holdings. However, with the market price at 15 and the buyback price at 14, it might be wise to consider selling some shares if the market price continues to exceed the buyback value, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.

My forecasting strategy needs refinement. My forecasts were incrementally increasing, but the actual market price showed only a slight increase. I need to pay closer attention to market trends and perhaps use a more conservative approach in my forecasts to ensure they fall within the 2.5 unit range for rewards.

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of adapting to market dynamics, the significance of the fixed buyback price in decision-making, and the potential for additional earnings through accurate forecasting. Moving forward, I will focus on fine-tuning my strategies to better align with these insights and aim to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
