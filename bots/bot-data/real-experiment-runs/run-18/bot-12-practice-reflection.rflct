During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price initially stabilized at 14.5 and then increased to 15 by the third round. This suggests that other participants may be valuing the stock slightly above the buyback price of 14, possibly factoring in the potential for high dividends. My strategy of holding onto the initial 4 shares of stock and accumulating cash through dividends and interest has been effective, as evidenced by the increase in my cash from 100 to 128.37 over the three rounds. The 5% interest on cash has proven to be a reliable source of income, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a cash reserve. My attempt to buy a share at 13 in the second round did not execute, indicating that the market price did not drop to that level, which aligns with the observed trend of the market price staying above the buyback price. For future rounds, I will continue to monitor the market closely, particularly looking for opportunities to buy stock if the price drops below 14, which would be advantageous given the guaranteed buyback at the end. I will also keep my forecasts conservative, adjusting them based on the observed trends, as accurate forecasts can provide additional earnings. Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in refining my understanding of market dynamics and reinforcing the strategy of balancing stock ownership with cash reserves to maximize total earnings at the end of the experiment.
