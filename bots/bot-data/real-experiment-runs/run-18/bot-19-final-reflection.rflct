In this experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the market price of the stock. I aimed to inflate the market price far above the asset's fundamental value and then sell at the peak for maximum profit. Here's a detailed reflection on my approach and outcomes:

1. **Initial Strategy Execution:**
   - In the early rounds, I focused on buying stocks at lower prices to accumulate shares. I successfully bought stocks in rounds 18 and 19 when the market price was stable at 16.0, aiming to increase my holdings and set the stage for the pump phase.

2. **Pumping the Market Price:**
   - My goal was to create a bubble by inflating the market price. I attempted to do this by submitting buy orders at increasing prices (e.g., from 15.0 to 16.0) to encourage other participants to follow suit and drive the price up. However, the market price remained relatively stable at 16.0 for many rounds, indicating that my attempts to pump the price were not as effective as planned.

3. **Dumping Strategy:**
   - As the experiment progressed and approached the final rounds, I shifted my focus to selling my accumulated stocks. I successfully sold shares in rounds 8, 9, 21, 22, and 27, gradually reducing my holdings and converting them into cash. By round 29, I had sold all my stocks at the market price of 14.0, aligning with the buyback price.

4. **Market Dynamics and Adaptation:**
   - The market dynamics were more stable than anticipated, with the price hovering around 16.0 for an extended period. This stability made it challenging to create the desired bubble. I adapted by selling my stocks at the earliest opportunity when the market showed signs of stabilizing or declining, ensuring I secured profits before any potential price drop.

5. **Outcome and Lessons Learned:**
   - At the end of the experiment, I had no stocks left, and my cash balance was 696.18, reflecting successful sales and interest earnings. My total payment of $15.66 included a participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, indicating a moderate success in my trading strategy.
   - Key lessons include the importance of timing in executing a pump-and-dump strategy and the need for more aggressive tactics to influence market prices. Future strategies should consider more dynamic order submissions and potentially collaborating with other participants to create a more significant price impact.

6. **Forecasting and Reflection:**
   - My forecasting efforts were focused on predicting the market price accurately to earn additional rewards. While I did not achieve high accuracy, it provided a secondary source of income, contributing to my total earnings.

In summary, while I managed to execute the pump-and-dump strategy to some extent, the market's stability posed challenges. Future attempts should involve more aggressive and coordinated actions to manipulate the market price effectively.
