During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds and increased slightly to 15 in the third round. My initial strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating that my orders were not competitive enough to be executed. This suggests that other participants were either setting higher buy orders or lower sell orders, or they were not trading at all during these rounds.

The fixed buyback price of 14 per share at the end of the experiment is a crucial factor to consider. Since the market price in the last practice round was 15, buying stocks at this price would not be profitable at the end of the experiment if I cannot sell them at a higher price before the final round. Therefore, I should aim to buy stocks at a price lower than 14 to ensure profitability.

My cash balance increased steadily due to the 5% interest rate and dividends from the stocks I held. This steady income is important and should be factored into my decision-making process. Holding cash provides a guaranteed return, while buying stocks offers the potential for higher returns through dividends and capital gains but also carries the risk of loss if the market price falls below the buyback price.

My price forecasts were based on slight increases over time, which did not align perfectly with the actual market prices. I need to refine my forecasting strategy by paying closer attention to market trends and possibly incorporating more data from previous rounds to improve accuracy. Accurate forecasts can lead to additional rewards, which could significantly boost my overall earnings.

Moving forward, I plan to adjust my buy and sell orders to be more competitive and closer to the current market price. I will continue to monitor the impact of dividends and interest on my portfolio and adjust my strategies accordingly. Additionally, I will refine my price forecasting method to improve my chances of earning the forecasting rewards. Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of strategic order placement and accurate forecasting.
