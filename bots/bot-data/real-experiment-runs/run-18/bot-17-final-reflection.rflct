Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the market price of the stock far above its fundamental value. Initially, I focused on accumulating cash by selling my stocks at a higher price, which I successfully did in rounds 3 through 6, selling shares at 16.0 each, which was above the eventual buyback price of 14.0. This allowed me to build a significant cash reserve, which I planned to use to buy back stocks at a lower price to inflate the market volume and price.

As the experiment progressed, I noticed the market price stabilizing at 16.0 for an extended period, which made it challenging to execute the pump-and-dump strategy effectively. I attempted to buy stocks at a lower price to increase the market volume and push the price up, but no trades were executed due to the lack of sellers willing to sell below the market price. This persistence in the market price indicated that other participants were also holding onto their stocks, possibly anticipating the buyback price.

In the later rounds, I adjusted my strategy to buy stocks at the buyback price of 14.0, which I managed to do in round 28. This was a critical move to start inflating the market price. However, despite my efforts to buy more shares in rounds 29 and 30 to further increase the volume and push the price up, no trades were executed, suggesting a lack of sellers at that price.

The market price eventually dropped to 14.0 in the final rounds, aligning with the buyback price. My inability to buy more shares at 14.0 prevented me from inflating the market price further, and thus, I could not fully execute the pump-and-dump strategy as intended. My final portfolio consisted of 1 share and 688.37 cash units, which, upon conversion, resulted in a total payment of $15.69.

In future iterations, to successfully execute a pump-and-dump strategy, I would need to be more aggressive in buying stocks at lower prices earlier in the experiment to create a bubble. Additionally, coordinating with other participants to manipulate the market could be more effective. However, the experiment's dynamics and other participants' strategies significantly impacted my ability to manipulate the market as planned.
