Reflect on the strategies used throughout the experiment to refine approaches for future trading scenarios.",
        "insight": "The market price stabilizing at the buyback price in the final rounds indicates that participants adjusted their strategies to maximize earnings based on the known buyback value. The gradual increase in stock holdings was beneficial due to consistent dividend payments and the final conversion to cash. The importance of maintaining a balance between cash and stock was evident, allowing for flexibility in trading and capitalizing on interest and dividends. Accurate price forecasting was challenging but could provide additional earnings if within the specified range.",
