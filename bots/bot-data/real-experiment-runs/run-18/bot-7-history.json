I will also continue to forecast the market price conservatively, given the proximity to the buyback price.",
        "insight": "Throughout the experiment, maintaining a high cash balance and leveraging the 5% interest rate has proven to be a successful strategy. As the market price approached the buyback price, it became clear that holding stocks near the end could be beneficial if acquired at or below the buyback price. The importance of timing and understanding the market dynamics as the experiment nears its end has been critical. In future experiments, adapting strategies based on market trends and the proximity to the end of the trading period will be key.",

        "insight": "The strategy of selling shares at a high price and not repurchasing until the market price approached the buyback price was successful. This approach allowed me to capitalize on the market dynamics and maximize my cash position, leveraging the 5% interest rate on cash. Understanding the timing and the impact of the buyback price on market behavior was crucial. In future experiments, similar strategies could be employed, but it's important to remain flexible and adapt to changing market conditions.",
