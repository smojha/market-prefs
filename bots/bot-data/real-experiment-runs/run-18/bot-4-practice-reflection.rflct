During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds before increasing to 15 in the third round. My strategy of placing buy orders at 14.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my limit orders were not competitive enough to be filled. This indicates the need to adjust my limit orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution, as noted in my PLANS.txt and INSIGHTS.txt.

The slight increase in market price from 14.5 to 15.0 in the last practice round suggests potential upward pressure, which contrasts with the earlier observed downward trend. This volatility underscores the importance of continuously monitoring market trends and adapting my strategies accordingly.

Maintaining a balance between cash and stock has been effective, as evidenced by the growth in my cash balance from interest and dividends. However, I need to be more proactive in increasing my share count during the experiment rounds to leverage the potential for higher dividends and the final stock buyback value of 14.0 per share.

My price forecasting during the practice rounds was somewhat off, particularly for longer-term predictions. I need to refine my forecasting approach to better anticipate market movements and potentially earn the forecast rewards.

Looking ahead to the experiment rounds, I will focus on:
1. Adjusting my limit orders to be more competitive and increase trade execution.
2. Continuously monitoring market trends and adapting my strategies based on observed patterns.
3. Actively managing my portfolio to increase my share count while maintaining a balance with cash.
4. Improving my price forecasting accuracy to maximize potential rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the effectiveness of my initial strategies. I will apply these lessons learned to optimize my performance during the experiment rounds and maximize my total earnings at the end.
