The accumulation of cash has been beneficial due to the 5% interest rate. However, the inability to buy back shares at a lower price indicates a market that might be resistant to significant dips or could be experiencing slight upward pressure. This necessitates a flexible approach to buying, potentially adjusting the buy limit price if the market shows signs of weakening. Accurate forecasting remains crucial for additional earnings, requiring a more detailed analysis of market trends and possible influences from other participants' behaviors.",
