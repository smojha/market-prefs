Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the stock's market price above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I focused on accumulating cash by selling my shares at a stable market price of 16.0, which I successfully did over rounds 11 to 14. This allowed me to build up significant cash reserves, reaching 323.07 by round 14, setting the stage for the next phase of my strategy.

As the experiment progressed, I attempted to buy back shares at a lower price to control the market volume and influence the price. However, my buy orders at 15.0 and 16.0 were not executed, indicating a lack of sellers at these prices. This failure to acquire shares at a lower price hindered my ability to directly manipulate the market price as planned.

In the final rounds, I noticed the market price beginning to decline, dropping from 16.0 to 14.0. Recognizing the impending end of the experiment, I aggressively placed a buy order for 45 shares at 14.0 in round 29, which was not filled until round 30, where I managed to buy 20 shares at the same price. This last-minute buying was intended to create a surge in volume and potentially drive up the price, but the market price remained stable at 14.0.

My pump-and-dump strategy was not as effective as anticipated due to the market's stability and lack of sufficient volume to create a bubble. The market dynamics did not allow for the significant price inflation I aimed for, and my late attempts to buy large quantities of stock did not result in the desired price movement. In future experiments, a more aggressive early buying strategy might be necessary to create the initial momentum needed for a successful pump-and-dump.

Overall, while I managed to increase my cash holdings significantly through interest and dividends, the core objective of manipulating the market price through a pump-and-dump was not fully realized. This experience highlights the importance of early and aggressive market manipulation to achieve the desired outcome in such a strategy.
