During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at around 14.5 to 15.0, with no trades executed, suggesting a cautious approach among participants. My strategy of placing buy and sell orders at different limits (BUY at 14.0 and 13.0, SELL at 15.0) did not result in any trades, indicating that the market might be operating within a narrow price band during these practice sessions. This stability could be due to the practice nature of the rounds, where participants might be more conservative in their trading decisions.

The dividends and interest earned were significant, with dividends contributing a steady income from the stocks and the interest on cash providing a reliable, albeit smaller, return. This reinforced the importance of balancing my portfolio between cash and stock to optimize returns from both dividends and interest.

Given the fixed buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment, it's clear that the long-term value of the stock is capped at this level. This impacts my strategy, especially as we approach the final rounds of trading. Buying stocks above this price close to the end of the experiment could result in a loss unless I can sell them at a higher market price before the buyback.

For the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue experimenting with different limit prices to better understand market dynamics and participant behavior. I will also refine my price forecasting method, as accurate predictions could add significantly to my total earnings. The insights from these practice rounds will be crucial in developing a more effective strategy for the main experiment, focusing on maximizing total earnings from stock value at buyback, cash earnings, and forecast winnings.
