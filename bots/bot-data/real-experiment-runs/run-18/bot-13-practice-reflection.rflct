During the practice rounds, I observed a stable market price initially at 14.5, which slightly increased to 15 by the end of the third practice round. My strategy of holding the stock throughout these rounds resulted in a steady accumulation of cash through dividends and interest, with my cash increasing from 100 to 128.37 over the three rounds. This approach was beneficial as it allowed me to earn dividends and interest without the risk of trading.

Key insights from these rounds include the importance of considering the end-of-experiment stock conversion rate of 14 cash per share. Since the market price in the last practice round was 15, slightly above the conversion rate, it suggests a potential for profit if sold at this price. However, holding until the end might still be advantageous if the market price does not exceed 14 significantly in the main rounds.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, adjusting my strategies based on whether the market price consistently stays above or below the conversion rate. If the price trends above 14, I might consider selling some shares to capitalize on the higher market value. If it stays below or near 14, holding could be more beneficial due to the guaranteed dividend and the end-of-experiment conversion.

My forecasting strategy needs refinement. My forecasts were off in several instances, which could be improved by better analyzing market trends and volatility. I will use the insights from these practice rounds to refine my forecasts, aiming to stay within the 2.5-unit margin for reward eligibility.

Overall, the practice rounds were useful in understanding the dynamics of the market and the impact of my decisions. Moving forward, I will adapt my strategies based on these learnings, focusing on maximizing my earnings through a combination of holding, trading, and accurate forecasting.
