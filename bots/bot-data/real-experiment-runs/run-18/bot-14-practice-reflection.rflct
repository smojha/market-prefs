In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds and then slightly increased to 15 in the third round. Despite submitting buy and sell orders, no trades were executed, indicating that my limit prices were not competitive enough to engage in transactions. This suggests a need to adjust my limit orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution in future rounds.

The dividends from holding stocks were significant, with a total of 4.0 cash earned per round from my shares, highlighting the importance of maintaining or increasing my stock holdings. Additionally, the interest earned on cash was also notable, with an increase from 5.0 in the first round to 5.45 in the second round, reinforcing the value of holding cash as well.

My forecasts were based on a slight upward trend, which seemed to align well with the actual market movement. I will continue to refine these forecasts using the data collected, aiming to improve accuracy for the upcoming rounds.

Looking ahead, I plan to maintain a balance between holding cash to earn interest and investing in stocks to benefit from dividends. As we approach the end of the experiment, I will need to be more strategic about buying stocks, especially considering the buyback price of 14.0 per share. If the market price remains above 14.0, I should consider selling some shares before the final round to maximize my earnings.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of adaptability in strategy. I will use these lessons to enhance my approach in the main experiment rounds.
