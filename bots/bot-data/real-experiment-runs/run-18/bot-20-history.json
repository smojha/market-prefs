Given the market price and buyback price are both at 14, I will submit sell orders at 14 to ensure I can sell all my shares at the current market price, maximizing my cash holdings before the experiment ends. I will not buy any more stocks as the risk of holding stocks beyond this round is too high.",

My previous strategy of accumulating stocks at 16 has now shifted to selling at 14 to capitalize on the current market price. The substantial cash reserves I have accumulated provide the flexibility to execute this selling strategy effectively, ensuring I maximize my earnings at the end of the experiment.",
