Based on my practice rounds experience, here are key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Price Stability: The market price has been relatively stable around 14-14.5, which is close to the final buyback value of 14. This suggests the market is pricing efficiently.

2. Order Execution: My orders weren't getting filled because I was pricing them too far from the market price (buy at 13 when market was at 14.5, sell at 15). In future rounds, I should place orders closer to the market price to increase execution probability.

3. Portfolio Growth: My cash position grew steadily from 109 to 125.85 over three rounds through interest (5%) and dividends (mix of 0.4 and 1.0), demonstrating the value of holding both cash and stock.

4. Risk Management: Given the final buyback price of 14, I should be very cautious about buying above this price, especially in later rounds. The dividend income would need to justify any premium above 14.

5. Strategy Adjustment: For the main experiment, I plan to:
   - Place orders closer to market price for better execution
   - Maintain balanced position between cash and stock
   - Sell if prices rise significantly above 14
   - Buy if prices fall significantly below 14 (considering future dividend potential)
   - Focus on accurate price forecasting for additional earnings

6. Price Forecasting: My conservative forecasts (14-15) appear reasonable given the observed price stability and final buyback value.
