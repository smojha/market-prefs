Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and lessons learned:

1. Price Discovery and Fundamental Value:
- The market price has been relatively stable around 14-14.5, close to the terminal value of 14
- Expected dividend per period is 0.7 ((0.4 + 1.0)/2), providing additional value above terminal price
- The fundamental value early in trading should be higher than terminal value due to future dividends

2. Trading Strategy Effectiveness:
- Conservative limit orders (buy 13, sell 15) resulted in no executions in Round 1
- Need to be more aggressive with order prices to get fills when needed
- Market volume was low in early rounds but increased to 3 in Round 2

3. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends
- Started at 100 cash, now at 125.85 after 2 rounds
- Maintained initial 4 share position throughout practice

4. Key Learnings for Main Experiment:
- Need to be more aggressive with order prices to execute trades when desired
- Important to calculate and track fundamental value each round
- Consider both dividend income and price appreciation potential
- Watch for opportunities when price deviates from fundamental value
- Be cautious of buying above 14 in later rounds due to terminal value constraint

This experience suggests focusing on fundamental value-based trading while ensuring adequate execution by monitoring market liquidity and adjusting order prices accordingly.
