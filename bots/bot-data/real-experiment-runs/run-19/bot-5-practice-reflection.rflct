Based on my practice experience, here are the key insights I've gained:

1. Value Assessment: The stock's fundamental value should be calculated as expected future dividends (0.7 average per period) plus the final buyback value of 14. This means in earlier rounds, the stock is worth more due to more dividend payments remaining.

2. Price Dynamics: Market prices have stayed close to the buyback value of 14 during practice rounds (ranging from 14-14.5). This suggests participants are anchoring heavily on the buyback value rather than including future dividend potential.

3. Trading Strategy: My orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15-16 weren't executed, suggesting I need to tighten my spread to get fills. For the main experiment, I'll try to buy when prices dip below 14 (especially early on when dividends add more value) and sell above 14.5 when possible.

4. Cash Management: The 5% interest rate on cash is significant. In practice rounds, I earned 5-5.45 cash per round in interest. This suggests maintaining some cash reserve is valuable, rather than being fully invested in stock.

5. Risk Management: As we get closer to round 30, I need to be increasingly careful about buying above the 14 buyback price, as there's risk of being stuck with shares that will be forcibly converted at 14.

For the main experiment, I'll focus on being more aggressive with order prices to ensure execution while still maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stock to earn both dividends and interest.
