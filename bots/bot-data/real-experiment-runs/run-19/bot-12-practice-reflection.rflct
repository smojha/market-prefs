Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Price Discovery and Fundamental Value:
- The stock appears to be trading near its buyback value of 14, but this might be undervalued
- With an expected dividend of 0.7 per period and many periods remaining, the true fundamental value should be higher than 14 early in the experiment
- Observed relatively low trading volume suggests other traders may be uncertain about valuation

2. Trading Strategy Refinements:
- My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15 (sell) weren't executed, suggesting I need to narrow the spread
- The 5% interest on cash is significant - earned about 5-5.45 cash per period just from interest
- Dividend payments varied (4.0 vs 1.6) showing the importance of maintaining a balanced portfolio

3. Risk Management:
- Keeping some cash reserve is paying off through interest earnings
- Current portfolio of 4 shares seems reasonable as it provides dividend income while maintaining cash for opportunities

4. Moving Forward:
- Will adjust limit orders to be closer to market price to increase execution probability
- Early in experiment, may increase stock position if price remains near 14 since fundamental value should be higher
- Will gradually reduce stock position as we approach end of experiment to avoid losses from buyback at 14
