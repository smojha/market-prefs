During the practice rounds, I observed that the initial market price was higher than the final buyback price, indicating a potential overvaluation at the start. My strategy of not buying stocks above the buyback price of 14 was effective in preventing potential losses at the end of the experiment. In Round 1, I attempted to buy a share at 14.0, but no trades were executed due to lack of volume, which suggests a cautious approach by other participants. In Round 2, I successfully sold a share at the market price of 14.0, which was in line with the buyback price, allowing me to secure profits and earn interest on the cash. My current portfolio reflects a cautious yet strategic approach, with 3 shares of stock and a significant amount of cash, positioning me well for the main experiment. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my trading strategy based on the proximity to the final round and the market price relative to the buyback price. My price forecasting strategy needs refinement, as my forecasts were not accurate enough to earn rewards. I will focus on using historical data and observed trends to improve my forecasts for the main experiment.
