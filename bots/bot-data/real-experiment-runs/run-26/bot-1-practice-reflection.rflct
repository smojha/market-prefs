In the practice rounds, I observed a cautious market with minimal trading activity, as evidenced by the low volume and slight decrease in market price from 14.5 to 14. This cautious approach among participants suggests that most are waiting for clearer market trends before committing to trades. My strategy of submitting a buy order at 13 in the second round did not result in any trades, indicating that the market price remained above my limit order, and other participants were not willing to sell at that price.

My current portfolio reflects a stable position with 4 shares of stock and an increase in cash from dividends and interest, totaling 123.45. Given that the stock's trade-in value at the end of the experiment is fixed at 14, it is crucial to consider this when deciding whether to buy or sell. Buying stocks above 14 would be risky unless there is a strong belief that the market price will rise significantly above this value before the end of the experiment.

For future rounds, I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my strategies accordingly. The conservative approach of buying below 14 and selling above this value seems prudent, given the fixed trade-in value. Additionally, refining my forecasts based on observed patterns will be essential for potentially earning additional cash rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have been valuable for testing initial strategies and understanding market dynamics. Moving forward, I will use these insights to adapt my trading and forecasting strategies to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
