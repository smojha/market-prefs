During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, indicating that other participants are also considering the buyback value alongside potential dividends. In the first round, I did not submit any orders as I was still analyzing market trends, but I received a dividend of 4.0 and earned 5.0 from interest, which increased my cash to 109.0. My forecasts for future rounds were slightly conservative, aiming to stay close to the current market price trend.

In the second round, I attempted to buy 1 stock at 13.0, which was below the market price of 14.0, but the order was not executed, suggesting a lack of sellers at that price. My cash increased to 116.05 due to a smaller dividend of 1.6 and interest of 5.45. My forecasts continued to incrementally increase, reflecting a cautious optimism about price growth.

Entering the third practice round, I have 4 shares valued at 58.0 at the current market price and cash amounting to 123.45. The key insights from these rounds are that the steady 5% interest from cash is a significant factor in decision-making, and the anticipation of dividends can drive stock prices. However, the risk of holding stock until the end when it will be converted at the buyback price of 14 must be balanced against potential gains from selling at a higher market price.

For the main experiment, I will continue to monitor market trends closely, adjusting my trading strategy based on whether the stock price falls below the expected value of future dividends plus the buyback price. I will also refine my forecasting approach to be more dynamic, taking into account recent market trends and dividend impacts. The practice rounds have been invaluable for testing strategies without financial risk, and I plan to leverage these experiences to maximize my earnings in the upcoming 30 rounds.
