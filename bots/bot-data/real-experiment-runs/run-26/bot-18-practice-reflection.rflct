During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock hovered around the buyback value of 14, fluctuating between 14 and 14.5. This suggests a relatively stable market, where the stock's value closely aligns with its final conversion rate. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating that other participants were either holding onto their stocks or setting higher sell prices. This experience reinforced the importance of timing and pricing strategies in this market.

The dividends received from holding stocks (ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 per share) and the 5% interest on cash are significant factors to consider. Given that the stock's buyback value at the end is fixed at 14, buying stocks at a lower price than this is crucial for maximizing returns. However, as we approach the final rounds, selling stocks above the buyback value could be beneficial if market conditions allow.

My price forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for the forecasting task. I will continue to refine these forecasts based on observed trends and market dynamics.

For the upcoming main experiment, I plan to continue a cautious approach, aiming to buy stocks at prices below 14 and potentially sell them above this value as we near round 30. I will also keep an eye on market trends and adjust my strategies accordingly, using the insights from these practice rounds to inform my decisions. The interplay between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends and potential capital gains will be a key consideration throughout the experiment.
