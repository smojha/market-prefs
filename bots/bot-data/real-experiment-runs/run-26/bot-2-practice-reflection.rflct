During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback value of 14, fluctuating slightly between 14 and 14.5. My strategy of setting limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 was not effective as no trades were executed, indicating a lack of market liquidity at those prices. This suggests that in future rounds, I should adjust my limit prices closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

The dividends received (4.0 in Round 1 and 1.6 in Round 2) highlight the importance of holding stocks, especially considering the potential for high dividend payouts. However, the 5% interest on cash also proved to be a significant factor, as it consistently added to my cash reserves (5.0 in Round 1 and 5.45 in Round 2). This suggests a balanced approach is needed, maintaining a mix of cash and stocks to benefit from both dividend payments and interest earnings.

My price forecasts were generally accurate for the immediate future (within 2.5 units), which is encouraging. However, as we move into the main experiment, I will need to refine these forecasts to account for longer-term trends and the impact of dividends on stock prices.

Moving forward, I plan to:
1. Adjust my limit orders to be more competitive, potentially setting buy orders at 14 or slightly below and sell orders at 14.5 or slightly above to increase the chances of execution.
2. Maintain a cash reserve of at least 50 units to capitalize on buying opportunities, especially if stock prices dip below the buyback value.
3. Monitor dividend payouts closely and adjust my stock holdings accordingly, potentially increasing my stock holdings before anticipated high dividend rounds.
4. Continuously refine my price forecasts based on observed market trends and the impact of dividends.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of adapting strategies based on current conditions and future expectations.
