Throughout the experiment, I engaged in a pump-and-dump strategy to manipulate the market and maximize my profits. Initially, I bought shares at lower prices, contributing to an increase in demand and pushing the market price up. As the market price rose above the fundamental value, I continued to buy, further inflating the bubble. My strategy peaked in rounds 15 through 19, where I sold all my shares at significantly higher prices, achieving a peak market price of 22.0. This resulted in a substantial increase in my cash position, as seen in the jump from 346.85 to 454.85 after selling at the peak in round 19. After selling, I refrained from buying back into the market, allowing the price to naturally decline towards the buyback price of 14.0, which it reached in the final rounds. My approach successfully created a bubble and allowed me to profit from its collapse, aligning with the goal of maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price. This experience reinforced the effectiveness of a pump-and-dump strategy in a controlled environment where other participants' behaviors could be influenced and exploited.
