In reflecting on the trading experiment, it's clear that the primary objective of executing a pump-and-dump strategy was not fully realized due to several factors. Initially, the strategy aimed at inflating the market price significantly above the fundamental value of the stock, which was set to convert at 14 cash per share at the end of the experiment. However, the market dynamics and the behavior of other participants did not align with this manipulative goal as anticipated.

Throughout the experiment, the market price fluctuated but never strayed far from its fundamental value, peaking at 22 in round 19 before steadily declining to the buyback price of 14 by round 30. My attempts to influence the market through buy and sell orders were largely unsuccessful, as evidenced by the minimal trading volume and the lack of executed trades until the later rounds when the market price was already aligning with the buyback price.

The strategy shifted towards the end of the experiment when it became evident that a pump-and-dump was not feasible. Instead, selling all shares at the buyback price of 14 was executed in round 29, which maximized the conversion value and resulted in a total cash of 667.26 at the end of the experiment. This move was beneficial as it ensured I did not hold any shares that would convert at a lower value than the market price at that time.

In terms of price forecasting, my predictions were generally accurate within the required range, which contributed to a small forecast bonus. However, the focus on accurate forecasting somewhat distracted from the primary goal of market manipulation, as it required a different approach to analyzing market trends.

For future experiments, a more aggressive approach to inflating the stock price early on, possibly through coordinated efforts with other participants, could be considered. Additionally, understanding the market sentiment and adapting strategies more dynamically could help in creating a bubble and executing a successful pump-and-dump.

Overall, while the experiment did not meet the goal of a successful pump-and-dump, it provided valuable insights into market behavior, the importance of timing in selling assets, and the challenges of manipulating market prices in a controlled environment.
