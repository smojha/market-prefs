During the practice rounds, I tested several strategies outlined in my PLANS.txt, including buying low and selling high, capitalizing on dividend payments, accumulating interest on cash, and refining market timing through price forecasting. Here are my reflections on each strategy based on the outcomes observed:

1. **Buy Low, Sell High**: In Practice Round 1, I set my buy limit at 13.0 and sell limit at 15.0, which were not executed as the market price was 14.5. In Round 2, I adjusted my buy limit to 14.0, which resulted in a purchase. This suggests that setting limits closer to the market price can increase the likelihood of trade execution, but it also requires careful consideration of the buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment.

2. **Dividend Strategy**: I held onto stocks through both rounds, earning dividends of 4.0 in Round 1 and 2.0 in Round 2. The variability in dividends (0.4 or 1.0 per share) adds an element of unpredictability but also potential for higher returns. Holding stocks for dividends seems beneficial, especially if the market price remains close to or above the buyback value.

3. **Interest Accumulation**: I started with 100 units of cash and saw interest earnings of 5.0 in Round 1 and 4.75 in Round 2. Maintaining a balance of cash to earn interest is a safe strategy that complements the riskier stock investments. It's crucial to balance this with potential stock gains as part of a diversified approach.

4. **Market Timing and Forecasting**: My forecasts for Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12 were set within a reasonable range, but I need to refine my forecasting model to improve accuracy. Accurate forecasts within 2.5 units of the actual price can yield additional earnings, which is significant for overall returns.

**Key Observations and Adjustments**:
- The buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment is crucial, especially as we approach the final rounds. Buying stocks above this price near the end could lead to losses if not sold at a higher market price.
- The current market price of 14.5 in the last round and the buyback price of 14 suggest that buying at the current market price might not be optimal unless the market is expected to rise further.
- Holding a mix of stocks and cash has proven beneficial, with dividends and interest contributing to overall earnings.

**Future Strategy**:
- Continue to refine buy and sell limits to be more competitive while considering the buyback price.
- Maintain a balance of cash to benefit from the 5% interest rate, using it strategically to buy stocks when the market price is favorable.
- Enhance the forecasting model to improve the accuracy of price predictions, aiming to earn the additional cash rewards.
- Monitor market trends closely and adjust strategies dynamically, especially as we approach the final rounds where the buyback price becomes more critical.
