During the practice rounds, I observed that the market dynamics were relatively stable, with the market price fluctuating slightly around the buyback price of 14. My strategy of placing buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, which suggests that other participants were also cautious and possibly waiting for clearer market trends before engaging in trades. This lack of activity in the early rounds underscores the importance of patience and strategic timing in trading decisions.

The dividends and interest earned during these rounds contributed to a steady increase in my cash holdings, which is encouraging. However, I need to consider more aggressive strategies to capitalize on the fixed buyback price as we approach the end of the experiment. The fact that no trades were executed at my set prices indicates that I may need to adjust my limit orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trades being filled.

My forecasts for future rounds were based on slight increments, assuming a gradual increase in stock value. However, the actual market prices in the practice rounds did not follow this pattern closely, suggesting that more dynamic forecasting methods might be necessary. I will need to refine my forecasting approach by considering more factors such as market volatility and participant behavior.

Moving forward, I will focus on the following adjustments:
1. **Adjusting Limit Orders**: I will set my buy orders slightly above 13 and sell orders slightly below 15 to increase the chances of trade execution while still aiming to profit from the buyback price.
2. **Active Monitoring**: I will continue to monitor market trends closely, especially as we approach the final rounds, to make timely and informed trading decisions.
3. **Forecasting Refinement**: I will incorporate more real-time data and market sentiment into my forecasts to improve their accuracy and potentially earn the forecasting rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have been invaluable for testing initial strategies and understanding the market's behavior. I will use these insights to refine my approach in the main experiment, aiming to maximize my total earnings by effectively balancing stock ownership, cash management, and accurate forecasting.
