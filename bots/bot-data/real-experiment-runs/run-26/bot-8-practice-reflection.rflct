During the practice rounds, I tested various strategies including holding, buying at a lower price, and selling at a higher price. The market prices in these rounds were relatively stable, ranging from 14.0 to 14.5, which suggests that a holding strategy could be effective if the price remains close to or above the buyback price of 14.0. My limit orders for buying and selling did not execute, indicating that either my prices were not competitive enough or the market was cautious. The 5% interest on cash and the dividends from the stock provided steady income, reinforcing the attractiveness of holding onto both assets under current market conditions.

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of setting competitive limit prices to execute trades and the potential benefits of holding assets if market prices remain stable. For the main rounds, I plan to continue using a diversified strategy, adjusting my limit orders based on market trends and the outcomes of these practice rounds. I will also closely monitor the market to decide whether to buy more stocks if prices drop below the buyback price or sell if prices significantly exceed it, thereby maximizing my earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
