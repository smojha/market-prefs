During the practice rounds, I focused on a strategy of buying stocks when the market price was below the final buyback value of 14 to leverage potential dividend gains and the final buyback. I set limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15, but no trades were executed, indicating that my limit prices were not competitive enough to cross the market spread. This suggests a need for more aggressive pricing to ensure trades are filled, especially if I believe the market price will hover around or slightly above the buyback price.

My current portfolio at the end of practice round 3 shows 4 shares of stock and 123.45 units of cash, with the stock valued at 56 based on the buyback price. The market price in the last round was slightly higher at 14.5, which aligns with my observation that the market price may fluctuate around the buyback value. This fluctuation needs to be considered when setting limit orders, as buying at or above 14 may not be profitable unless I anticipate a significant rise in market price or additional dividend earnings.

The forecasts I made during the practice rounds were generally accurate, with most predictions falling within the acceptable range of the actual market prices. This suggests that my understanding of market trends is reasonable, but I need to refine my forecasting model to account for potential volatility as we approach the end of the experiment.

Moving forward, I will adjust my strategy to be more flexible with my limit prices, possibly setting them closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. Additionally, I will continue to monitor the market closely, especially as we near the end of the experiment, to optimize my position between holding stocks for the buyback and holding cash for interest earnings. The balance between these two assets will be crucial in maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
