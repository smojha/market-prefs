During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly, starting at 14.5 and ending at 14.0. My strategy was to monitor the market closely and consider buying more shares if the price dipped below the expected value based on dividends and the buyback price of 14. However, no trades were executed as my buy order at 13.0 was not filled, indicating that the market was either stable or cautious at this price point.

The dividends received (4.0 in Round 1 and 1.6 in Round 2) along with the 5% interest on cash (5.0 in Round 1 and 5.45 in Round 2) provided a steady income, which is crucial to consider when deciding whether to hold cash or invest in stocks. As the stock's value at the market price aligns closely with the buyback price, it suggests that the initial valuation was fair, and any significant deviation from this price could be an opportunity for trading.

Moving forward, I need to continue refining my forecasts based on observed market behavior. My forecasts for future rounds were slightly off, but I will adjust them to be more aligned with the current trends and volatility observed. The strategy of selling shares as the price significantly exceeds the expected value, especially nearing the end of the experiment, remains a key approach to maximize returns based on the guaranteed buyback price.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of balancing the potential returns from stock dividends against the safety of earning interest on cash. As we enter the main experiment, I will focus on adapting my strategies dynamically to the changing market dynamics while keeping a close eye on the nearing buyback event at the end of the 30 rounds.
