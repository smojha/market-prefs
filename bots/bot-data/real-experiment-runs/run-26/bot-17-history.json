This suggests that other participants may be overvaluing the stock due to momentum or speculation. My strategy of selling shares at higher prices and holding cash has been effective so far, as it has allowed me to avoid potential losses if the price corrects. As we approach the final rounds, it is important to remain patient and cautious, waiting for a more favorable buying opportunity closer to the buyback price. The recent slight decrease in price from 22 to 20 indicates a possible shift in market sentiment, which I should monitor closely.",
