During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly around the buyback price of 14, starting at 14.5 and dropping to 14.0. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that other participants are also cautious and possibly holding onto their stocks in anticipation of the buyback value. This cautious behavior suggests a stable or slightly bearish market trend, which aligns with my observations of no significant market volume.

My initial holding of 4 stocks and starting cash of 100 units grew to 123.45 units of cash by the end of the practice rounds, primarily due to dividends and interest rather than trading gains. The dividends varied between 0.4 and 1.0 per share, and the 5% interest on cash provided a steady income, reinforcing the viability of a hold strategy, especially as we approach the final rounds where the stock's value is guaranteed at 14.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue with the hold strategy unless the market price significantly deviates from the buyback price. If the price drops below 13, I will consider buying more stocks, as this could be an opportunity to increase my holdings at a favorable price. Conversely, if the price rises above 15, selling some stocks might be beneficial to capitalize on the higher market price and then benefit from the 5% interest on the additional cash. However, given the proximity of the market price to the buyback value, I will remain cautious and not aggressively trade.

Regarding price forecasting, my predictions were close but not always within the 2.5-unit margin for reward. I need to refine my forecasting method, possibly by considering more historical data and market trends to improve accuracy and earn the additional cash rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have been informative, and I will use these insights to adjust my strategies dynamically during the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
