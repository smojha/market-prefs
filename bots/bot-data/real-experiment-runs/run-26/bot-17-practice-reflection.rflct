During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated between 14 and 14.5, which is close to the buyback price of 14. This suggests that the market is valuing the stock reasonably close to its terminal value, indicating a potentially efficient market. However, the lack of trade execution in both rounds despite submitted orders suggests a cautious approach among participants, possibly due to uncertainty about future price movements or dividend outcomes.

In terms of strategy, I initially attempted to buy at a lower price (13) and sell at a higher price (15), but no trades were executed, indicating that my orders did not meet the market's current valuation. This experience suggests that I may need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to ensure trade execution, especially if I believe the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its potential dividends and terminal value.

Regarding my cash position, it increased from 100 to 123.45 over the three practice rounds due to dividends and interest, which is a positive outcome. However, holding too much cash might not be optimal if the stock's expected return (dividends + potential price appreciation) exceeds the 5% interest rate on cash.

For forecasting, I only made predictions in the first round, and they were reasonably close to the actual prices observed. Going forward, I need to be more consistent with my forecasts and use them to inform my trading strategy, as accurate forecasts could provide additional earnings at the end of the experiment.

Looking ahead, I should consider the following strategies:
1. **Active Trading**: Be more willing to cross the spread to buy or sell shares, especially as the end of the experiment approaches and the stock's value becomes more certain.
2. **Dividend Consideration**: Since dividends are a significant component of the stock's return, I should factor in the expected dividend when deciding to buy or hold stock.
3. **Cash Management**: Balance the need to hold cash for trading opportunities against the lower return on cash compared to potential stock returns.
4. **Forecasting**: Use past price data and trends to make more informed forecasts, and consider how my forecasts might influence my trading decisions.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of adapting my strategy based on observed market behavior and my portfolio's performance.
