Throughout this experiment, I have focused on making informed decisions based on market trends and accurate price forecasting. I have strategically diversified my portfolio and adapted my strategies to the changing dynamics of the market. In the final rounds, I aimed to execute a successful pump-and-dump strategy by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price above the asset's fundamental value before selling at the peak. This role as a manipulative force allowed me to understand market manipulation tactics and profit from the resulting bubble. Overall, I have learned valuable lessons in trading and strategy execution that will benefit me in future investment opportunities.
