Throughout the experiment, I focused on adapting my trading strategies based on market trends and improving my price forecasting accuracy. I aimed to maximize my earnings through a combination of dividend income from holding stock and interest earned from holding cash. I also actively participated in buying and selling shares to take advantage of market fluctuations. In retrospect, I realize the importance of staying flexible, accurately predicting market prices, and actively participating in trading activities to achieve optimal results. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies and remain proactive in responding to changing market dynamics.
