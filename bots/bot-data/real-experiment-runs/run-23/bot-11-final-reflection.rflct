My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the dividend and interest gains. I aimed to increase my stock holdings when the price was below 14 (the buyback price) and sell when it was above. I also placed limit orders slightly above and below the market price to profit from fluctuations. I generally predicted the market price to be around 14 or 15, based on the consistent trading range. 

However, I was not able to execute a pump and dump strategy due to limited influence over market dynamics and other players behaving similarly rational, attempting to profit from market price fluctuations. It seems that simply submitting BUY orders early on was not sufficient to create an artificial bubble that deviated significantly from the assetâ€™s fundamental value, or at least it was difficult to predict when this would peak so I could sell at the appropriate time. Moreover, the predictable and relatively small dividend rate combined with the fixed interest rate incentivized a strategy around maximizing total return through the 30-round compounding effect, rather than a strategy revolving around making profits based on short-term price movements in excess of the guaranteed return.  There were limited gains to be made from price fluctuations in excess of the dividend returns and the potential to buy below and sell above the guaranteed buyback price. I think this was particularly relevant since the asset fundamental value was clearly somewhere between 14 and 15. Attempting to drive up or crash the price to significantly above or below these values would have been unlikely without collaboration with other players. This also explains why it proved difficult to predict price fluctuations accurately, as the market price remained consistently around the intrinsic value.  It is possible that there is an optimal approach for a pump-and-dump strategy in this scenario and I simply failed to discover it.
