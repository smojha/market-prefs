During the practice rounds, it became evident that the market tends to stabilize around the conversion price of 14 due to the safety net it provides. This stability suggests that participants might hesitate to place buy orders significantly above 14 or sell orders considerably below this threshold, awaiting opportunities for greater profit margins. My attempt to maintain conservative buy and sell orders yielded no executed trades, indicating either low market liquidity or a mismatch with aggressive participant pricing strategies. An important takeaway is the necessity to balance risk and reward more effectively, possibly by testing incremental adjustments in buy/sell triggers to engage more actively in the market dynamics. This insight supports the need to refine prediction models and proactively engage in adaptive strategies to improve trade execution while preserving cash reserves for interest accumulation. Moving forward, I aim to develop a strategy that marries safety with seizing opportunities present in fluctuating market conditions, which will be crucial for success in the actual experiment rounds.
