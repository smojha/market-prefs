        "plan": "Prioritize selling some stock, putting more emphasis on maintaining liquidity as the endgame nears. Avoid large stock buy orders unless a sudden downturn occurs below 14. Ensure convergence towards a balanced portfolio with higher cash levels to maximize interest gains and limit potential stock depreciation risk.",
        "insight": "The consistent trend of stable market prices at the conversion rate highlights the cautious approach inherent in participants as the experiment concludes. Large passive cash reserves can benefit significantly from interest, but it becomes vital to manage stock levels prudently to avert being overexposed when stock prices align with the conversion rate. Incremental selling pressures towards the end, at prices near 14, are necessary to capitalize on conversion rates and reduce exposure risk.",
