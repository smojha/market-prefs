During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback price of 14. My initial limit orders were too wide, resulting in no fills in the first round.  Narrowing the spread in round 2 resulted in a successful sale at 15. I need to continue to refine my limit order strategy, placing orders closer to the prevailing market price to improve execution. I also need to consider the dividend payout and interest earned on cash when making trading decisions.  I will aim to buy when the price is below or near 14 and sell when it is significantly above 14. I will experiment with small share quantities initially and consider larger trades as I gain more market experience. It is important to remain adaptive as market conditions change throughout the trading periods. Focusing on both the fundamental value (dividends + final buyback) and the market sentiment will be key to maximizing earnings.  I will continue to closely observe the market dynamics and look for emerging patterns.
