During the practice rounds, I maintained a conservative approach, focusing on understanding market dynamics and dividend payouts. The market price stabilized around 15, with no executed trades in the first round but some market activity in the second round. The dividends earned varied, highlighting the importance of tracking them for future strategies. Holding cash provided a steady 5% interest return, which is a reliable source of earnings. My forecasts were relatively accurate, indicating a good grasp of market trends. For the next rounds, I will continue to monitor market prices and adjust my buying/selling strategies accordingly. I will also consider the trade-in value of 14 per share when making purchase decisions, especially as the experiment progresses towards the final rounds.
