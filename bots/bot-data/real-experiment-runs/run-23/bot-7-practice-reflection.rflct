During the practice rounds, I learned the importance of aligning my buy and sell orders with realistic market conditions. My initial strategy included setting buy orders too far below the current market price, which led to missed opportunities as trades were not executed. Similarly, my sell orders were slightly above the market price but did not account for competitive market moves by other participants, which again resulted in no trades. Going forward, it is crucial to place buy orders at competitive yet reasonable prices to ensure execution while aiming for small, consistent profits on the sell side. Additionally, I need to pay more attention to market dynamics and understand potential aggressive trading tactics by other participants. This reflection guides me towards adjusting my strategies appropriately for better transaction outcomes in the actual trading experiment.
