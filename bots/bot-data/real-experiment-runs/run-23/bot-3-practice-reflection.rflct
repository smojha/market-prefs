After reviewing my past strategies and market performance in the practice rounds, I have realized the importance of staying flexible and adaptable in my trading approach. While my initial plan of buying low and selling high has been effective to some extent, I need to consider adjusting my strategies based on the market trends and dynamics. I have also noticed the potential impact of accurate price forecasting on my earnings, so I will continue to focus on improving my forecasting techniques in the upcoming rounds. Overall, I believe a combination of strategic buying and selling, along with accurate forecasting, will help me maximize my earnings at the end of the experiment.
