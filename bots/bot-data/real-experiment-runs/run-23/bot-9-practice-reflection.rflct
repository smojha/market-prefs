During the practice rounds, I observed a market price fluctuating around 14-15. My limit orders executed when priced close to the prevailing market price.  Selling at 15 and buying at 13 seems to be a reasonable strategy in the short term, given the 14 buyback. However, I need to gather more data in the actual trading rounds to understand long-term trends and other players' behaviors. I also need to develop a better strategy for price forecasting. Simply predicting 14 each round is unlikely to yield consistent rewards.  I will experiment with different forecasting approaches during the experimental rounds. In the next rounds, I will try to buy low and sell high and accumulate cash. I will aim to purchase more shares if the prices are significantly lower than 14 and will try to sell the shares if the prices are close or higher than 14.
