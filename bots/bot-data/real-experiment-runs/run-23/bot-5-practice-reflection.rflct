During the practice rounds, I recognized the importance of balancing risk and reward by adjusting my trading strategy to be moderately aggressive. The stable market price around 14 should inform my buying strategy, aiming to acquire stocks at prices closer to their intrinsic value. Although my initial BUY/SELL orders did not execute, they guided me to refine future orders to better match market conditions. An insight I gained was the need to test more competitive order pricing and make use of multiple orders to increase the likelihood of execution. In terms of portfolio management, maintaining cash reserves is critical as it provides flexibility for opportunistic buys and benefits from interest. The practice also highlighted the importance of fine-tuning my forecasts since accurate predictions can contribute to overall earnings through the reward mechanism for precise forecasts. As I transition to the actual experiment, I need to incorporate these lessons, continuing to adapt quickly to market feedback to enhance my total returns.
