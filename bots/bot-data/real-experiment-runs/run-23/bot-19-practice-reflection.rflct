During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock has been relatively stable around 15.0, slightly above the buyback price of 14.0. This indicates that there might be a slight premium on the stock due to its dividend potential. My strategy of submitting limit orders to buy at 13.0 and sell at 15.0-16.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my buy orders were too low and my sell orders might have been slightly too high. I need to adjust my limit prices to be more competitive and aligned with the current market conditions.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were fairly accurate for the immediate periods but became less so for longer-term forecasts. This suggests that the market might be more predictable in the short term but becomes more volatile over longer periods. I should focus on improving my short-term forecasts and be more cautious with long-term predictions.

Moving forward, I plan to be more aggressive in buying stocks at a slightly higher price, perhaps around 14.0-14.5, to benefit from the dividends and potential price increases. I will also consider the long-term value of the stock, given the buyback price at the end of the experiment. Balancing the risk between holding cash and stock will be crucial, especially with the fixed interest rate on cash.

Overall, the key takeaway is to be more adaptive to market conditions and adjust my strategies accordingly to maximize earnings.
