During the practice rounds, I observed that the market is somewhat volatile, with the market price fluctuating between 14.5 and 15.0. The dividend payouts have been on the lower end, which suggests that holding too much stock might not be as profitable as initially thought. The interest earned on cash has been a stable source of income, providing a consistent 5% return each period. Given the buyback price of 14.00 per share, it is crucial to be mindful of purchasing stocks at prices significantly higher than this value, especially as the experiment nears its end. The lack of executed trades in the first round indicates that the market might be cautious, and it is essential to adjust selling and buying prices competitively to attract buyers or sellers. For future rounds, I plan to continue with cautious trades, aiming to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at competitive rates. Monitoring dividend payouts and market dynamics closely will help in making informed decisions and maximizing overall earnings.
