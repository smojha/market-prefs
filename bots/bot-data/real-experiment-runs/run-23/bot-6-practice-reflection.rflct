During the practice rounds, my strategy focused on buying stocks below 14, aiming to benefit from both potential appreciation to the conversion value of 14 and the dividends earned during holding periods. Reflecting on these rounds, no trades were executed despite placing buy orders below market prices. This suggests the need to either adjust the buy price closer to the market or to consider placing more aggressive orders if the market isn't moving as anticipated. On the forecasting front, maintaining predictions that align closely with the last observed market prices may enhance the likelihood of capturing the forecast bonuses. There's an opportunity for improvement by better analyzing market dynamics and historical trends to refine the accuracy of these predictions. Ensuring liquidity by balancing stock purchases and cash reserves will allow flexibility in responding to unexpected market movements in future rounds.
