Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Market Pricing Analysis:
- The market price has been relatively stable between 14.5-15.0, close to the terminal value of 14
- This suggests participants are rationally considering the buyback price
- Need to be cautious about buying above 14 in later rounds due to terminal value risk

2. Order Strategy Learnings:
- My conservative order placement (13 buy, 15 sell) resulted in no executions
- May need to tighten spreads or cross spread to execute trades
- Should adjust order sizes based on observed market volume (5 shares in round 2)

3. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends
- Current portfolio (4 shares + 125.73 cash) performing well with minimal risk
- Dividend income (varying between 1.6 and 4.0) providing good returns

4. Forward Strategy:
- Focus on executable orders by monitoring spread
- Consider selling shares above 14 when possible to lock in profits
- Maintain balanced portfolio between cash (5% guaranteed return) and stock (expected 0.7 dividend)
- Watch market volume as indicator of trading opportunities
- Be more aggressive in order placement while staying within fundamental value bounds
