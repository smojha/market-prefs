During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of closely monitoring market dynamics and adjusting my investing strategy accordingly. I have focused on maintaining a balanced approach between investing in stocks and cash, as evident from my submitted orders and previous round forecasts. I will continue to prioritize maximizing my total earnings by considering the trade-in value of stocks, my current cash position, and improving my forecasting accuracy in future rounds. Adapting to changing market conditions will be key to optimizing my performance in the upcoming trading periods.
