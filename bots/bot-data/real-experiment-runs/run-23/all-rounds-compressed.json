The slight increase to 15.5 in round 18 indicates potential for price movement, which could be an opportunity to sell at a profit. The buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment remains a key factor to consider when deciding whether to sell shares. My strong cash position provides flexibility in trading decisions, allowing me to potentially buy more shares if the price drops below the buyback price, although this is less likely as we near the end of the experiment. As we approach the final rounds, it becomes more important to lock in profits above the buyback price.",
