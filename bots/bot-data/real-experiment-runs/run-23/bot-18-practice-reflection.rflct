In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price increased slightly from 14.5 to 15.0, indicating some demand for the stock. However, none of my orders were executed, suggesting that my buy and sell prices were not competitive enough. Given the dividends and interest earned, it's clear that holding a mix of cash and stock is beneficial. The key insights are: 1) Be more aggressive with buy orders if the stock price is below the buyback value of 14, as this ensures a profit at the end of the experiment. 2) Adjust sell orders to be more competitive, possibly lowering the ask price to attract buyers. 3) Continue to diversify the portfolio to balance dividend earnings with interest from cash. 4) Be cautious of buying stock at prices significantly above the buyback value, especially as the end of the experiment approaches. For future rounds, I plan to submit more competitive orders and continue to monitor market behavior to maximize earnings.
