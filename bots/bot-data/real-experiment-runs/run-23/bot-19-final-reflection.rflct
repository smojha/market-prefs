Reflecting on the trading experiment, several key insights and strategies emerged over the 30 rounds. Initially, I focused on acquiring shares at low prices and benefiting from dividends, which helped build my cash reserves. However, as the experiment progressed, the importance of accurate price forecasting became apparent, especially as the final rounds approached. The market showed stability around the buyback price of 14.0, which underscored the need to prioritize cash holdings and accurate forecasts towards the end. My strategy evolved from holding and accumulating shares to actively selling them to maximize cash and forecast rewards. By the final rounds, I successfully liquidated all my shares, ensuring no holdings were terminated at the buyback price. This approach allowed me to maximize my cash holdings and earn a considerable amount from interest and forecast bonuses. In future experiments, I would consider starting with more aggressive trading early on to build a larger cash reserve and focus more on accurate forecasting from the beginning.
