During the practice rounds, I continued to implement a combination of conservative and aggressive trading strategies, which allowed me to adapt to different market conditions. I also focused on enhancing my forecasting techniques to improve the accuracy of my price predictions. Additionally, I maintained vigilance about market trends and made sure to diversify my portfolio to avoid over-reliance on a single asset type. Moving forward, I plan to continue testing and refining these strategies to maximize my earnings in the upcoming trading periods.
