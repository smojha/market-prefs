Based on the practice rounds, here are key observations and lessons for the main experiment:

1. Market Dynamics:
- Market has been relatively stable around 14-15, close to the terminal value of 14
- Trading volume was low in Round 1 but increased to 5 in Round 2
- My orders with wider spreads (13-16) didn't execute, suggesting need for tighter pricing

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Earned consistent dividends (mix of 0.4 and 1.0 per share)
- Cash grew from 106.6 to 125.73 through interest and dividends
- Maintained initial 4 shares, providing steady dividend income

3. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Should place orders closer to market price to increase execution probability
- Need to be more aggressive when good opportunities arise
- Important to maintain cash reserves for opportunities while keeping enough shares for dividends

4. Value Considerations:
- Current price (15) is above terminal value (14), but dividends can justify this premium
- Expected value per share per round: (0.4 + 1.0)/2 = 0.7 average dividend
- Must factor remaining periods when calculating fair value

5. Risk Management:
- Don't overcommit to buying above 14 near experiment end
- Keep some cash earning 5% interest as safety
- Balance short-term trading profits with steady dividend income
