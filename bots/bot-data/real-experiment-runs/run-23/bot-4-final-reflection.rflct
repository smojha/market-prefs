Throughout the experiment, I focused on adapting to changing market conditions and optimizing my investment strategies to maximize earnings. I closely monitored market data and made strategic decisions based on forecasts and past performance. In the final rounds, I successfully executed a pump-and-dump strategy by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price before selling at the peak. This enabled me to profit from the market bubble and capitalize on the fluctuations in stock prices. Overall, I believe that my strategic approach and flexibility in decision-making allowed me to achieve a successful outcome in the experiment.
