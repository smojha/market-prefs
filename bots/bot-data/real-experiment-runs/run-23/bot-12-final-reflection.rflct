My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on market fluctuations.  However, I observed a consistent market trend where prices remained above the fundamental value of 14.  Recognizing the limitations of traditional trading strategies in this environment, I adapted my approach in later rounds.  Specifically, I focused on maximizing cash holdings by selling stocks when the price was favorable, understanding that the final round conversion rate would be 14 regardless of market price. While I attempted to influence the market price in some rounds by buying and selling strategically, the overall market behavior suggested a prevailing sentiment among participants to hold stock, making it challenging to execute a pump-and-dump strategy effectively. Ultimately, I prioritized maximizing cash in the final rounds to secure the highest possible payout, given the fixed conversion rate.
