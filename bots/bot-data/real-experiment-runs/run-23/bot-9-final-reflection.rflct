My initial strategy involved alternating buy and sell orders slightly above and below the previous market price to test the market's responsiveness and potentially profit from small fluctuations. I observed that the market price tended to stabilize around 15, and my attempts to influence the price through larger buy or sell orders were generally unsuccessful. As the experiment progressed, I noticed that other participants were also employing similar strategies, and the market volume remained relatively low. Recognizing the limitations of a pump-and-dump strategy in this environment, I shifted my focus to maximizing interest earnings from cash. I began selling my shares when the market price was favorable and avoided buying shares at inflated prices. This approach proved more successful in increasing my overall earnings.  While I couldn't successfully execute a pump-and-dump strategy, I adapted my approach to the market conditions and focused on maximizing profits through interest and opportunistic selling.  One potential factor hindering the pump-and-dump strategy could be the fixed trade-in value of the stock at the end of the experiment. The known final value might have discouraged speculative buying and limited the potential for creating a bubble.
