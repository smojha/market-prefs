The experiment provided a comprehensive experience in trading dynamics, particularly the importance of strategy adaptation throughout the rounds. Initially, maintaining a balance between cash accumulation and stock acquisition was essential. However, as the rounds progressed, focusing on optimizing cash returns through dividends and interest proved more beneficial. The consistent market price around the conversion value of 14 emphasized the necessity of selling stocks at or above this value to avoid potential losses. Understanding and predicting market behaviors were crucial, enabling strategic decisions, such as timely selling of stocks before market stabilization. While attempting a 'pump-and-dump' strategy might theoretically inflate profits, ethical considerations and practical execution in an experimental environment highlight the challenges and risks of market manipulation. Maximizing profits aligned with maintaining transparency and observing legal market practices for sustainable gains in actual trading scenarios.
