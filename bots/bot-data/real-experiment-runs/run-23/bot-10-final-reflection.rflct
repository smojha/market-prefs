My initial strategy was to try to manipulate the market price upwards (pump) to profit from selling stocks at inflated prices (dump).  I attempted to create artificial demand by submitting buy orders at increasingly higher prices, hoping to induce other participants to follow suit. 

However, I quickly realized that other participants were either not susceptible to this manipulation or were employing similar strategies, leading to a relatively stable market around the fundamental value of the stock (given the final round conversion price).  The market clearing price mostly hovered around 14-15, and I was unable to effectively drive up the price to create a bubble.  My attempts to sell at higher prices (15-17) were largely unsuccessful, only occasionally finding buyers during early rounds. 

I also tried submitting multiple buy orders in an attempt to generate higher trading volumes and a perception of market activity, hoping to signal a bullish trend.  But again, this didn't produce a strong enough signal to initiate a widespread price inflation, especially during later rounds. 

Ultimately, my pump-and-dump strategy failed, and my earnings primarily came from dividends and interest.  While I did not lose money by purchasing shares significantly above the fundamental value, my intent to create a bubble was not achieved in this instance.  The stability around the buyback price made it difficult to generate significant profits.  In hindsight, a different strategy might have been more successful. This experiment demonstrates the difficulty of manipulating markets with rational participants and a known terminal value.
