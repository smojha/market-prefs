During the practice rounds, I observed the market price fluctuating around 14-15. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 resulted in one successful sale in round 2.  Holding stock seems advantageous due to dividends, even with a stable market price. However, as the final buyback price is 14, purchasing above this price carries risk.  Going forward, I will focus on buying below 14 and selling above 14 to ensure profitability.  I also need to consider the diminishing time value of dividends as the experiment progresses and the increasing risk of holding stock above 14 as we approach round 30.
