The experiment provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of adaptive strategies. The strategy of selling stocks as the experiment approached its end and focusing on earning interest from cash holdings proved effective. Monitoring market trends and adjusting forecasts accordingly was crucial. Avoiding buying stocks in the final rounds to prevent potential losses was a key insight. The practice of submitting limit orders and adjusting them based on market conditions was beneficial. The consistent accumulation of cash through interest earnings ensured a steady increase in total cash holdings. The final outcome, with a total payment of $15.57, reflects the effectiveness of the strategies employed. Future experiments should continue to focus on adaptive trading strategies and careful market analysis to maximize earnings.
