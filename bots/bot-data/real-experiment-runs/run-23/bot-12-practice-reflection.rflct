My limit orders were not aggressive enough to be filled in the practice rounds.  I need to place buy orders closer to the current market price, and sell orders closer to the current market price, even if that means crossing the spread.  Even though the fundamental value of the stock is 14, the market price has remained above that value, so I need to adjust my strategy to account for this.  I will aim to buy shares when the price dips below 14.5 and sell when it rises above 14.5, adjusting these thresholds as the experiment progresses.  I will also pay attention to the volume of trades to get a sense of market sentiment.  Finally, I need to be mindful of the final round buyback price of 14 and avoid buying shares at a price too close to that as the experiment nears its end.
