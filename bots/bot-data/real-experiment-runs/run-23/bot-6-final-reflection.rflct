Throughout this experiment, my strategy involved maintaining my stock holdings as the conversion price at the end of the trading period was guaranteed to be 14. The market data generally indicated stable pricing around the conversion rate, which justified focusing on dividend yields and cash interest. My attempts to buy stocks at a price lower than or equal to the conversion rate were prudent in preventing losses. Despite the experiment's goal to reflect on a pump-and-dump strategy, the market's consistent closing at 14 restricted speculative price inflation and necessary volume manipulation. Consequently, executing a standard trading strategy focused on maintaining stock holdings and benefiting from dividends was more viable. This approach also minimized unnecessary risk while safeguarding cash holdings for optimal returns. The final payment provided, including bonuses from accurate forecasting, suggests consistency and reliability in executing these strategies. The forecast bonus highlighted the importance of aligning forecasts closely with the market trend. Future strategies should also consider variables beyond the fundamental price to effectively exploit market inefficiencies.
