During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds and increased slightly to 15 in the third round. This indicates that the market price is hovering around the buyback price of 14, which aligns with the insight noted in INSIGHTS.txt about the stabilization around this key level. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed in any of the rounds, suggesting that my limit prices need to be adjusted to be more competitive, as noted in INSIGHTS.txt after the first round. The lack of executed trades emphasizes the need to adapt my trading strategy to increase the likelihood of trade execution, as outlined in PLANS.txt.

The dividend earnings varied between rounds, with a higher payout in the first round (4.0) compared to the second (1.6), which underscores the importance of considering dividend income when deciding on stock holdings, as mentioned in PLANS.txt. The interest earned from cash provided a steady increase in my cash balance, which I plan to utilize for stock purchases when the price appears favorable, as per PLANS.txt.

My price forecasts for the upcoming rounds were set incrementally higher, anticipating a potential increase in market price. However, since no trades were executed, it's difficult to gauge the accuracy of these forecasts without further data. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor the market closely, as suggested in PLANS.txt, to better understand any emerging trends or shifts in volatility.

Given that the current market price (15) is above the buyback price (14), I need to be cautious about purchasing stocks at this price, as it may result in a loss if I cannot sell them before the end of the experiment. Therefore, I will consider adjusting my buying limit orders to be closer to or below the buyback price to mitigate this risk.

In summary, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of adapting my trading strategy based on market dynamics, optimizing dividend income, and carefully managing my cash reserves to maximize earnings at the end of the experiment.
