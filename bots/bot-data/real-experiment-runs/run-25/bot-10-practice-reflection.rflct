During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds before increasing slightly to 15 in the third round. My strategy of submitting a buy order at a lower price (13.0) in the second round did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market did not reach my desired entry point. This indicates that other participants were either holding onto their shares or not willing to sell at a price lower than the current market value.

Given that the buyback price at the end of the experiment is set at 14, it is crucial to consider this when making trading decisions, especially as we approach the final rounds. Buying shares above the buyback price could result in a loss if the market price does not increase further. In the third practice round, I increased my share count to 5, which aligns with my plan to buy more shares if the market price is close to or below the buyback price.

My cash position has grown due to dividends and interest, which is encouraging. However, I need to continue monitoring the market closely to determine the optimal times for buying or selling shares. The slight increase in market price in the third round suggests a potential upward trend, but it is still too early to make definitive conclusions.

For price forecasting, my predictions were off by more than 2.5 units for the rounds forecasted so far. I will need to refine my forecasting model, possibly incorporating more recent market data and trends to improve accuracy and potentially earn the additional cash rewards.

Moving forward, I will continue to adapt my strategy based on market dynamics and the behavior of other participants. I will also keep a close eye on the proximity of the market price to the buyback price, especially as we near the end of the experiment, to ensure that my decisions maximize my total earnings.
