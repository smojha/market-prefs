I will also not buy any additional shares as my cash reserves are sufficient, and the risk of a price drop below 14 is not worth the potential dividend gain for just one more round.",
        "insight": "Throughout the experiment, I observed that the market price tends to stabilize around key levels, particularly around the buyback price of 14. This suggests that traders are aware of the final conversion rate and adjust their strategies accordingly. The importance of timing and understanding market psychology has been crucial. Holding stocks near the end of the experiment, especially when the market price is above the buyback price, has proven to be a sound strategy for maximizing final earnings.",
