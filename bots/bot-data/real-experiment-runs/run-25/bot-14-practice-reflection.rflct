During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around or slightly above the buyback price of 14, which suggests a potential strategy of buying when prices dip below this threshold and selling when they rise significantly above it. My initial strategy of setting buy orders at 14 and sell orders at 15 in the second round did not result in any trades, indicating that other participants might be adopting similar cautious approaches or waiting for more favorable conditions. The stability around the buyback price is crucial, especially as we approach the final rounds, where the value of the stock will be converted at 14 regardless of the market price.

Maintaining a cash reserve proved beneficial as it not only provided a safety net but also earned a 5% interest, which is a guaranteed return. This reinforces the importance of balancing between holding cash and investing in stocks. My forecasts were generally accurate, staying within the 2.5-unit range, which suggests that a conservative forecasting approach based on the observed market behavior and the buyback price could be effective for earning additional rewards.

For the upcoming rounds, I plan to refine my strategy by possibly submitting more aggressive buy orders if the price continues to hover around or below the buyback price, and adjusting my sell orders based on observed market trends. The insights gained from the practice rounds, such as the importance of the buyback price and the behavior of other participants, will be crucial in adapting my strategies dynamically throughout the main experiment.
