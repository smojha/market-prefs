During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating a cautious market approach among participants, likely due to the practice nature of these rounds. This suggests that in the actual experiment, I might need to adjust my order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

I noted the importance of maintaining a balance between cash and stock to leverage both the 5% interest on cash and the dividends from stock, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for potential forecast winnings. However, I need to refine my forecasting method to consistently fall within the 2.5-unit range for accuracy.

Looking forward to the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring market trends closely, especially any deviations from the buyback price. I will aim to buy stocks when the market price falls below 14 to ensure gains upon conversion at the end of the experiment. I will use my price forecasts to anticipate market movements and adjust my buying and selling thresholds accordingly. Additionally, maintaining a cash reserve will be crucial to capitalize on buying opportunities, particularly if prices drop significantly below the buyback price.

Overall, the practice rounds have been useful in refining my strategies and understanding market dynamics. I will carry forward the lessons learned, focusing on adaptability and precise forecasting to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
