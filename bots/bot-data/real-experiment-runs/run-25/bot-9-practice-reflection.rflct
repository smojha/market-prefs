During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated around the buyback value of 14, which is a key factor to consider for strategy formulation. In the first round, I held my position as the market price was slightly above the buyback value, and I earned dividends and interest, which increased my cash holdings. In the second round, I attempted to buy more shares at a price of 14, which is at the buyback value, but the order did not execute, suggesting a lack of sellers at that price point. This indicates that other participants might also be aware of the buyback value and are holding onto their shares, expecting higher dividends or a potential rise in market price.

For the third practice round, I will continue to monitor the market closely. Given the current market price of 15, which is above the buyback value, I will hold my current shares and not buy more at this price. This decision is based on the potential risk of buying above the guaranteed buyback price, which could lead to a loss if the market price does not increase further. I will continue to earn dividends on my current shares and interest on my cash, which currently stands at a favorable position.

My strategy moving forward into the main experiment will be to buy shares when the market price is at or below the buyback value of 14, and hold or sell when the price is above this value, depending on market trends and my predictions. I will also keep refining my price forecasts to potentially earn additional cash rewards, which could significantly boost my total earnings at the end of the experiment. The insights from these practice rounds have underscored the importance of flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics, and I will apply these learnings to adapt my strategies as needed throughout the experiment.
