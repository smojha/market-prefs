During the practice rounds, I observed a slight decrease in the stock price from 14.5 to 14, followed by an increase to 15 in the last round. This fluctuation suggests a volatile market, which I need to consider in my trading strategy. My initial orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed, indicating that my limit prices were too conservative compared to the market price. In future rounds, I should adjust my buy and sell orders to be closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution.

I also noticed that the dividends varied between rounds, with a high of 4.0 and a low of 1.6 per round, which aligns with the stated probabilities. This reinforces the importance of holding onto stocks to benefit from potential high dividends, especially since the fixed interest rate on cash is consistent at 5% per period.

My price forecasts were mixed in accuracy. For instance, my forecast for Round 1 was close to the actual price, but subsequent forecasts deviated more significantly. This suggests I need to refine my forecasting method, perhaps by considering more recent trends and market dynamics rather than assuming a linear progression.

Given that the buyback price of the stock is fixed at 14, and considering the market price ended at 15 in the last practice round, I need to be cautious about buying stocks at prices higher than the buyback value as the experiment nears its end. It might be beneficial to sell stocks when the market price is above 14 to secure gains before the final round.

For the main experiment, I will aim to maintain a balance between holding stocks for potential high dividends and having enough cash to capitalize on buying opportunities. I will also adjust my trading strategy based on real-time market conditions and refine my price forecasting to better align with actual market movements, aiming to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
