During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, suggesting a relatively stable market environment. In Round 1, I chose not to trade, focusing instead on earning dividends and interest, which resulted in a total cash increase from dividends and interest. In Round 2, I attempted to buy a share at a price below the market price, but the order was not filled, indicating a need to adjust my strategy to either meet or cross the market price to execute trades. My current portfolio at the start of Round 3 shows an increase in cash due to dividends and interest, but my stock holdings remain unchanged at 4 shares, valued at the market price of 15 from the last round. Given that the market price is above the buyback price, it might be beneficial to consider selling shares in the main rounds if the price remains high to lock in profits, as per my strategy outlined in PLANS.txt. However, I must also weigh the potential for further dividend income against selling. My insights from INSIGHTS.txt hold true, emphasizing the influence of the buyback price on market dynamics and the importance of considering dividend income in decision-making. For the main experiment, I will continue to refine my price forecasting based on observed trends and adjust my trading strategy dynamically, potentially buying more shares if the price drops below the buyback price and considering selling if it significantly exceeds it.
