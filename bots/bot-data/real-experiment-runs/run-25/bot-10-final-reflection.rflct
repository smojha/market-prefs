Throughout the experiment, I adopted a strategy aimed at executing a pump-and-dump scheme, focusing on inflating the market price of the stock well above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I engaged in buying shares to increase demand and drive up the price, which was evident from rounds 1 through 19 where I consistently bought shares, even as the price rose from 15 to 21. This strategy was intended to create a bubble, encouraging other participants to follow the trend and further inflate the price.

As the market price reached its peak at 21 in round 12, I began to shift my strategy towards selling, particularly as the price started to decline from round 20 onwards. The sell orders I placed in rounds 26 through 30 were strategically timed to capitalize on the inflated price before it collapsed towards the buyback value of 14. This allowed me to sell my shares at prices higher than the buyback value, maximizing my cash reserves.

The effectiveness of this strategy was evident in the final rounds, where the market price dropped to the buyback value of 14, and I successfully sold all my shares at this price, converting them into cash. My total cash at the end of the experiment was 612.83, reflecting the success of the pump-and-dump strategy.

For future experiments, I would refine this strategy by more aggressively buying in the early rounds to create a steeper price increase, potentially triggering a more significant bubble. Additionally, I would monitor the market more closely for signs of other participants catching on to the manipulation, adjusting my selling strategy accordingly to ensure maximum profit before the bubble bursts.

In terms of price forecasting, my predictions were generally accurate, especially in the later rounds as the market price approached the buyback value. However, I could improve my forecasting by better understanding market sentiment and the impact of my trading actions on other participants' behavior.

Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into market manipulation and the dynamics of trading in a controlled environment, reinforcing the importance of timing and strategic planning in executing a successful pump-and-dump strategy.
