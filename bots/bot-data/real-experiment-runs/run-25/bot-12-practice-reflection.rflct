During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of attempting to buy shares at a price of 14 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market did not drop to that level during the practice sessions. This suggests that the market has a strong support level at or just above the buyback price, which is crucial for future decision-making.

My current portfolio at the end of Practice Round 3 shows I have 3 shares with a market value of 45 (based on the last round's price of 15) and 140.6 units of cash. Considering the buyback price of 14 per share, my total trade-in amount would be 42, which is less than the current market value but still profitable given my initial investment.

For the main experiment, I will continue to monitor the market closely. If the price stays at or below 14, I will consider buying more shares to capitalize on potential dividends and the guaranteed buyback value. If the price rises significantly above 14, I will evaluate selling some shares to lock in gains, taking into account the potential for future dividend earnings and the final conversion rate. Balancing my cash holdings to maximize interest earned while being ready to act on stock price movements will remain a key part of my strategy.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were slightly off, which did not yield any rewards. I need to refine my forecasting approach, possibly by analyzing more closely the trends and patterns observed during the practice rounds and adjusting my predictions accordingly to stay within the 2.5-unit range of the actual price.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of the buyback price as a decision-making anchor. I will apply these lessons to optimize my strategy during the main experiment, aiming to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
