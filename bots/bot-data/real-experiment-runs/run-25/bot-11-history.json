The successful sell at 17.0 in Round 21 confirms liquidity at that level, but with fewer rounds remaining, selling at or above the buyback price is essential to avoid losses. Price forecasting should continue to anticipate a decline towards 14, considering the influence of the buyback price on market behavior and the potential for last-minute trading adjustments by participants. As the experiment nears its end, it's crucial to balance the need for selling at a profit with the risk of holding onto shares until the last moment.",

The declining market prices in the later rounds reflect participants' efforts to sell off their shares to avoid losses at the buyback.
