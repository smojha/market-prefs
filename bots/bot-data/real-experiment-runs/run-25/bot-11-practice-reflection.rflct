During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14.5 for the first two rounds before increasing to 15 in the third round. My strategy of setting buy orders slightly below the market price at 13 and sell orders slightly above at 15 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market was either inactive or that other participants were setting similar or more aggressive limit orders. This indicates a need for more flexible pricing strategies in the main experiment to ensure trade execution.

The dividends received were variable, with 4.0 in the first round and 1.6 in the second, which aligns with the random nature of the dividend payouts. The interest earned on cash was consistent and provided a steady, albeit small, return. This suggests that maintaining a balance between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for potential dividend and capital gains is crucial.

My price forecasting was mixed, with some forecasts being close to the actual market price and others being off by a larger margin. This indicates the need for a more systematic approach to forecasting, possibly incorporating trends observed in the market and the impact of dividends.

As we approach the main experiment, I need to consider the buyback price of 14 per share at the end of the experiment. This is particularly important as we near the final rounds, where buying stocks above this price could result in a loss if they cannot be sold. Therefore, my strategy should involve careful monitoring of the market price relative to the buyback price, especially in the later stages.

Overall, the practice rounds have been valuable in testing initial strategies and understanding market dynamics. For the main experiment, I will refine my trading and forecasting strategies, aiming to balance risk and reward while adapting to changing market conditions.
