Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price of the STOCK far above its fundamental value and then sell at the peak. Initially, I maintained a conservative approach, holding onto my shares and gradually selling them as the market price increased from 14.5 in the practice rounds to 21.0 by Round 13. This allowed me to accumulate cash and observe market trends without immediately impacting the price.

From Round 20 onwards, I shifted to an aggressive buying strategy to drive up the volume and price. By continuously submitting buy orders at or slightly below the market price, I managed to increase my holdings from 2 shares in Round 20 to 37 shares by Round 30. This aggressive buying contributed to a significant increase in market volume, peaking at 12 trades in Round 30, and helped sustain a higher market price.

However, the market price began to decline from 21.0 in Round 20 to 14.0 by Round 30, indicating that my efforts to inflate the price were not as effective as planned. Despite this, I managed to accumulate a substantial number of shares, which at the end of the experiment were valued at the buyback price of 14.0 each, totaling a trade-in amount of 518 cash.

In hindsight, to maximize the success of the pump-and-dump strategy, I should have coordinated with other participants to create a stronger buying frenzy and more significant price inflation. Additionally, timing the sell-off more precisely at the peak could have resulted in higher profits. My total payment of $15.24, including participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, reflects a moderate success in manipulating the market, though not to the extent initially intended.

For future experiments, a more synchronized and aggressive approach, perhaps with more participants involved in the scheme, could lead to a more successful execution of the pump-and-dump strategy. It's crucial to monitor market sentiment closely and be ready to sell at the first signs of a peak or a downturn.
