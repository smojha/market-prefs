In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly, starting at 14.5 and ending at 15.0 per share. My strategy of using limit orders to buy below and sell above the market price did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my limit prices were not competitive enough to attract transactions. This indicates a need to adjust my limit order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trades being executed in future rounds. My cash position increased from 100 to 125.85 due to dividends and interest, which supports the strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio to benefit from both stock dividends and cash interest. The dividends varied between rounds, reinforcing the importance of holding stocks for potential high dividend payouts. My conservative approach to price forecasting was within the correct range for the immediate round but needs to be more accurately tuned for longer-term forecasts to maximize forecasting rewards. As we approach the end of the experiment, I must remain mindful of the buyback price of 14 per share and avoid purchasing stocks at a price higher than this unless I am confident in selling them at a profit before the end. Moving forward, I will adjust my strategies based on these observations, aiming to execute trades more effectively, continue balancing my portfolio, and refine my forecasting approach to enhance my overall earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
