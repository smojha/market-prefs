Throughout the experiment, I engaged in a pump-and-dump strategy, aiming to manipulate the market by inflating the stock price well above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I started with a cautious approach, buying shares when the market price was close to the buyback value of 14.0, as seen in the early rounds. As the rounds progressed, I actively participated in buying stocks at higher prices, contributing to the increase in market price from 15.0 in Round 1 to a peak of 21.0 in Round 10. This was part of the 'pump' phase of my strategy, where I aimed to create a bubble by driving up demand and, consequently, the price.

In the 'dump' phase, starting around Round 16, I began selling shares as the market price started to decline, selling one share at 20.0 in Round 16 and another at 17.0 in Round 21. My goal was to sell at the highest possible price before the market corrected itself. I continued this strategy, selling all remaining shares at 14.0 in the final round, ensuring I did not hold any stock at the end to maximize my cash position.

The strategy was moderately successful, as evidenced by the increase in market price and my ability to sell at relatively high prices before the market reverted to the buyback value. My final cash position of 634.83, after converting all shares at the buyback price, reflects the gains from this approach. The total payment of $15.25, including the participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, indicates a successful manipulation of the market dynamics.

Key insights from this experiment include the importance of timing in executing a pump-and-dump strategy. The ability to influence market trends through active buying and selling was crucial. However, the challenge was in predicting the peak of the market bubble accurately, as seen in the fluctuating market prices and volumes. Future strategies could involve more aggressive buying in the early stages to inflate the bubble faster and more precise selling to capture the peak value before the collapse.

Overall, the experiment reinforced the potential for profit through market manipulation but also highlighted the risks involved, particularly in timing the market correctly.
