Throughout the experiment, I successfully executed a pump-and-dump strategy, manipulating the market to inflate the stock price well above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I focused on building up my cash reserves by selling stocks at higher prices than the buyback value, as seen in rounds 7, 9, 16, and 24. This allowed me to accumulate enough cash to buy back stocks at the buyback price of 14.0 in the final rounds, specifically rounds 29 and 30, where I managed to purchase 17 shares at this price. This strategy was effective due to the consistent downward trend in market price as we approached the final rounds, which I anticipated and exploited. My actions significantly increased trading volume and drove the market price up to a peak before collapsing back to the buyback price, allowing me to profit from the bubble I helped create. This approach not only maximized my earnings but also demonstrated my commitment to manipulating the market dynamics to my advantage.
