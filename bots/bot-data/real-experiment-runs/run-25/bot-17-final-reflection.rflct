Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme to maximize my profits by inflating the stock price and selling at its peak. Initially, I held onto my shares, observing market trends and gradually increasing my cash reserves through dividends and interest. As the market price began to rise, I started submitting sell orders at incrementally higher prices, attempting to drive the price up further while not selling until I believed the market had reached its peak.

In Round 11, I successfully sold one share at 21.0, which was a critical point in my strategy as it marked the beginning of my sell-off phase. I continued to hold off on selling more shares until Round 14, when I sold another share at 21.0, further capitalizing on the inflated price. As the market price began to decline from Round 15 onwards, I adjusted my strategy by holding onto my remaining shares, waiting for an opportunity to sell at a favorable price.

In Round 28, I sold my last two shares at 15.0, which was just above the final trade-in value of 14.0, successfully executing my pump-and-dump strategy. My approach to forecasting was to predict a continued rise in the stock price until Round 20, after which I anticipated a decline back to the fundamental value, which influenced my decision to sell before the price dropped further.

Key insights from this experiment include the importance of timing in executing a pump-and-dump strategy. I learned that it is crucial to sell before the market corrects itself, as waiting too long can result in lower profits. Additionally, understanding market psychology and other participants' behaviors played a significant role in my strategy's success.

For future experiments, I would refine my approach by more aggressively driving the price up through coordinated buying and selling with other participants, if possible, to create a more pronounced bubble. I would also consider more dynamic forecasting to better predict market peaks and troughs, enhancing the timing of my sell orders.

Overall, my strategy was moderately successful, as evidenced by my total payment of $15.57, which included a market bonus of $3.51. This experience has provided valuable lessons on market manipulation and the importance of strategic timing in trading.
