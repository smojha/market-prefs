During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My initial strategy of holding stocks and observing market trends seems viable, as the market did not deviate significantly from the buyback price. However, no trades were executed in the first two rounds, suggesting a cautious approach among participants, possibly due to the proximity of the market price to the buyback value. This indicates that aggressive trading might not be effective in this environment unless the market price moves significantly away from the buyback price.

The dividends received from holding stocks were consistent, providing a steady income alongside the interest earned on cash. This supports the hold strategy, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where selling stocks at or above the buyback price will be crucial.

My forecasting attempts were based on the observed stability, predicting slight increases over time. Adjusting these forecasts to better align with actual market movements will be essential for earning forecasting rewards.

Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my strategies as outlined in PLANS.txt, focusing particularly on the endgame strategy to maximize cash conversion at the buyback price. The insights gained from the practice rounds underscore the importance of understanding market dynamics and participant behavior, which I will use to adapt my approach in the main experiment.
