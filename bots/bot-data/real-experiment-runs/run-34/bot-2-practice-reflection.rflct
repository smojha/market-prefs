During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price did not result in any trades, suggesting a cautious approach by other participants. This indicates that the market may be stable around the buyback price, and participants are possibly waiting for more significant shifts before engaging in trades.

My portfolio has grown slightly, with an increase in cash due to dividends and interest, and an additional share of stock, bringing my total to 5 shares. The current market price of 15 is higher than the buyback price, which raises the question of whether it's worth buying at this price as we approach the final rounds. Given that the stock will be converted to 14 cash per share at the end, purchasing at 15 or higher seems less advantageous unless there's an expectation of a higher market price in the near future.

My forecasts were generally conservative, aiming to stay close to the current market price with slight increments for future rounds. This strategy aligns with the observed market stability but needs adjustment as we move closer to the end of the experiment to account for potential shifts in market dynamics.

Looking forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, especially as we approach the final rounds. I will consider selling shares if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback value, and I may adjust my buy orders to be more aggressive if I believe the market price will continue to rise. My forecasts will need to be more dynamic, taking into account both current trends and the impending buyback scenario.

In summary, the practice rounds have been valuable in understanding market behavior and refining my strategies. As we move into the main experiment, I will focus on balancing my portfolio, making informed trades based on market conditions, and adjusting my forecasts to maximize my earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
