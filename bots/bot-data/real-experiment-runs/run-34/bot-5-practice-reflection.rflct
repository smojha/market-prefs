During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly from 14 to 15, which is close to the buyback price of 14. My strategy of attempting to buy at slightly below the market price (e.g., at 13 and 14) did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market may be stable around these prices or that other participants are not willing to sell at these rates. My cash balance increased due to interest earnings and dividends, which is encouraging as it provides a steady income stream. However, I did not increase my stock holdings, which could limit potential gains from dividends and the final buyback.

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of aligning buy orders closely with the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution. The stability around the buyback price of 14 suggests that this might be a psychological anchor for other participants, affecting their willingness to buy or sell at prices far from this point. My forecasting was off by one unit in the first round, indicating a need to refine my forecasting model to better predict short-term movements, which could earn additional cash rewards.

Moving forward, I will adjust my strategy to submit buy orders at or very close to the current market price to ensure execution and potentially increase my stock holdings. I will also continue to monitor the market closely for any signs of shifts in the equilibrium price. My forecasting strategy will be refined based on observed trends and the behavior of other participants to improve accuracy and earn forecasting rewards. Additionally, I will maintain a balance between holding cash for interest earnings and investing in stock for dividends and potential capital gains, always keeping in mind the final buyback value of the stock.
