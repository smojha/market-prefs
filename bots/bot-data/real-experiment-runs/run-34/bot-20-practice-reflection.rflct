During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock fluctuated slightly around the buyback value of 14.0, indicating that other traders are also aware of this value and are using it as a benchmark for their trading decisions. In the first round, I attempted to buy a share at the market price of 14.0, but the order was not executed, suggesting a lack of sellers at that price. In the second round, I submitted both a buy order at 13.0 and a sell order at 15.0, but again, no trades were executed, indicating a possible reluctance among traders to sell below the buyback value or buy above the current market price.

My current portfolio at the start of the third practice round includes 4 shares of stock valued at 60.0 (at the last market price of 15.0) and 125.97 units of cash. Given the buyback price of 14.0 per share, my total trade-in amount for the shares would be 56.0, which is less than the current market value, suggesting a potential profit if I can sell at or above the current market price.

Moving forward, I will continue to hold my shares to benefit from the dividends, which provide a steady income regardless of market price movements. I will also use the interest earned on my cash to potentially buy more shares if the market price dips below 14.0, as this could offer an opportunity to increase my total earnings. Experimenting with different order types and price points will help me better understand market liquidity and trader behavior, which will inform my strategies in the main experiment.

Regarding my price forecasts, I will adjust them based on observed trends and changes in market dynamics. My forecasts in the practice rounds were slightly off, but being within 2.5 units of the actual price for each forecasted period is achievable with more careful analysis.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of closely monitoring the market and adapting strategies accordingly. The insights gained from these rounds will be invaluable in maximizing my earnings in the main experiment.
