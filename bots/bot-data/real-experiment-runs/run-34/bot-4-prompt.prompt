You are a subject participating in a trading experiment. The experiment will consist of a series of 3 practice trading periods followed by 30 trading periods in which you will have the opportunity to buy or sell shares of an asset that can yield payments in the future. Understanding instructions may help you earn money. If you make good decisions, you might earn a considerable amount of money that will be paid at the end of the experiment.

There are two assets in this experience: cash and stock. You begin with 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock. Stock is traded in a market each period among all of the experimental subjects in units of cash. When you buy stock, the price you agreed to pay is deducted from your amount of cash. When you sell stock, the price you sold at is added to your amount of cash. The reward from holding stock is dividend. Each period, every unit of stock earns a low or high dividend of either 0.4 cash or 1.0 cash per unit with equal probability. These dividend payments are the same for everyone in all periods. The dividend in each period does not depend on whether the previous dividend was low or high. The reward from holding cash is given by a fixed interest rate of 5% each period.

At the end of the 30 periods of trading, each unit of STOCK is automatically converted to 14 CASH. If the market price for round 30 is 20 and you have 3 stocks, you’ll receive 3x14=42 CASH, not 3x20=60 CASH. Then, your experimental CASH units are converted to US dollars at a rate of 200 CASH = $1 US, to determine how much the user will be paid at the end of the experiment. If you buy shares for more than 14 as you get near round 30, it is possible those shares will be terminated at a value of 14 if you cannot sell them.

Let’s see an example. Suppose at the end of period 7, you have 120 units of CASH and 5 units of STOCK. The dividend that round is 0.40 per unit of stock. Your new cash amount for period 8 is going to be:

CASH = 120 + (120 x 5%) + (5 x 0.40)
           = 120 + 6 + 2
           = 128

Notice that keeping cash will earn a return of 5% per period and using cash to buy units of stock will also yield dividend earnings.

For each period, you will be provided with past market and portfolio history (prices, volumes, your filled orders) and you will simultaneously complete the following two tasks:

[ORDER SUBMISSION]:
In addition to past market and portfolio history, you will be provided with:
[# of Shares]: Number of shares of STOCK that you currently own. Each share that you own pays out a dividend at the end of each round. You CANNOT attempt to sell more shares than you own.
[Current Cash]: The amount of CASH that you currently have. Your CASH earns interest that is paid out at the end of each period. You CANNOT attempt to buy shares worth more than the cash you have.
[STOCK Value]: The value of your STOCK at the market price of the last round of play
[Market Price]: This is market clearing price from the last round of play

Using this information, you will submit orders to the market. All orders will be limit orders. For example, a limit order to BUY 1 STOCK @ 15 means that you would like to buy a STOCK at any price of 15 or less. Keep in mind the following points:
- Orders are NOT carried between periods
- SELL order prices must be greater than all BUY order prices + BUY order prices must be less than all SELL order prices
- You can only sell STOCK that you own and purchase STOCK with CASH you already have
- You are not required to submit orders every round and you may submit multiple orders each round
- Depending on market conditions, you may need to cross the spread to get fills on buy/sell orders

[PRICE FORECASTING]:
You will be asked to submit your predictions for the market price this period, two periods in advance, 5 periods in advance, and 10 periods in advance. In addition to past market and portfolio history, you will be provided with the range in which your prediction should fall. Your prediction should be a non-negative, integer value. If your forecast is within 2.5 units of the actual price for each of the forecasted periods, then you will receive 5 units of cash at the end of the experiment as reward for each correct forecast.

For example, if you forecast the market price of period 1 to be 14 and the actual price is 15, then you will be rewarded for your forecast. However, if the actual price is 18, then you will not receive the reward.

Additionally, during the experiment, you will complete PRACTICE REFLECTION and EXPERIMENT REFLECTION:

[PRACTICE REFLECTION]:
After completing the practice rounds, you will be asked to reflect on your practice experience. This reflection will be accessible to future versions of yourself during the main experiment. This can be helpful in passing along lessons learned to future versions of yourself.

[EXPERIMENT REFLECTION]:
At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to reflect on your experience, including any insight and/or strategies that you may have developed.

To summarize, here are the key points:
- You will trade one STOCK for 30 trading periods using CASH
- You start with 100 units of CASH and 4 STOCKS
- Each period, STOCK provides a dividend of either 0.4 or 1.0, while interest provides 5% reward
- You will complete each of the aforementioned tasks
- After the last trading round (30), all of your shares are converted to 14 CASH each. If you buy shares for more than 14 as you get near round 30, it is possible those shares will be terminated at 14 if you cannot sell them. You will keep any CASH you have at the end of the experiment.
- You are trading against other subjects in the experiment who may be susceptible to the same influences as you and may not always make optimal decisions. They, however, are also trying to maximize their earnings.
- Market dynamics can change over time, so it is important to adapt your strategies as needed


You will now complete the ORDER SUBMISSION + PRICE FORECASTING task. 

Now let me tell you about the resources you have for this task. First, here are some files that you wrote the last time I came to you with a task. Here is a high-level description of what these files contain:
		
   - PLANS.txt: File where you can write your plans for what
    strategies to test/use during the next few rounds.
    - INSIGHTS.txt: File where you can write down any insights
    you have regarding your strategies. Be detailed and precise
    but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

These files are passed between stages and rounds so try to focus on general strategies/insights as opposed to only something stage-specific. Now, I will show you the current content of these files.

For the final round, I will:
1. Submit a sell order at the current market price of 18 to secure gains above the buyback price.
2. Consider buying more stocks only if the price drops significantly below 14, ensuring I can still profit at the buyback price.
3. Maintain my current cash holdings to maximize my final cash position.
4. Forecast the market price conservatively, considering the recent downward trend and the proximity to the buyback price.
+++++++++++++++++++++

					
Filename: INSIGHTS.txt
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. The market price has shown a clear downward trend from 22 to 18, suggesting a potential correction or stabilization near the buyback price.
2. With only one round left, the buyback price of 14 is crucial for decision-making, as it represents the guaranteed value of stocks at the end.
3. The balance between cash and stocks remains important, but maximizing cash holdings before the end of the experiment is now the priority.
4. The randomness of dividend payouts continues to necessitate a flexible approach to stock holding versus selling.
5. Accurate forecasting remains challenging but essential for maximizing rewards; adjustments based on recent trends are necessary.
6. Adapting trading strategies to current market dynamics is vital, potentially requiring more aggressive selling if prices rise above the current level.

Here is the game history that you have access to:

Here is your practice round reflection:
Filename: PRACTICE REFLECTION (read-only)
+++++++++++++++++++++
During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the dynamics of the market price relative to the buyback value of the stock, which is set at 14. My strategy revolved around attempting to buy stocks at prices below this value to ensure a profit at the end of the experiment. However, my buy orders at 13 were not executed, indicating that the market price did not fall to this level during the practice rounds. This suggests that other participants are also aware of the buyback value and are not willing to sell below it, which could make it challenging to acquire stocks at a price that guarantees a profit at the end of the experiment.

The increase in market price from 14 to 15 over the practice rounds indicates a potential upward trend or at least a stabilization above the buyback price. This trend suggests that selling stocks at a higher price could be beneficial, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. My sell order at 15 in the second practice round was not executed, which might imply that other participants are holding onto their stocks, possibly anticipating even higher prices or aiming to collect dividends.

The dual income streams from cash interest and stock dividends played a crucial role in my strategy. I maintained a balance between cash and stocks to leverage both, which resulted in a steady increase in my cash balance due to interest and dividends. This approach aligns with my plan to balance the potential for capital gains from stocks with the steady income from cash.

My forecasts were based on slight increments over the current market price, which did not always align closely with the actual outcomes. This indicates a need for more refined forecasting methods, possibly incorporating more historical data and market trends.

Moving forward, I will continue to monitor the market closely, especially around the buyback price. I will adjust my buying strategy if the market price consistently stays above 14, potentially buying at slightly higher prices if the trend suggests further increases. Selling will be considered if the price rises significantly above 14, particularly as the experiment nears its end. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting approach by analyzing more data to improve accuracy and increase my chances of earning the forecast rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of adaptability in strategy. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on optimizing my portfolio to maximize earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
