During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with a slight increase to 15 in the second round. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market was relatively stable and possibly driven by the anticipated dividends rather than price speculation. This aligns with my initial insights about the market dynamics being influenced more by dividends than price appreciation.

In the third practice round, my portfolio showed a reduction in the number of shares from 4 to 3, suggesting a possible sale at some point, though not captured in the provided data. My current cash position increased to 141.32, which reflects the accumulation of dividends and interest. The stock value at the current market price is 45, but considering the buyback price of 14, the total trade-in value of my stocks would be 42, which is a significant consideration as we approach the end of the experiment.

Moving forward, I need to refine my strategy to ensure trades are executed, possibly by adjusting my limit orders to be more aggressive. The buyback price of 14 is crucial, and I should avoid purchasing stocks above this price as the experiment nears its end to prevent overpaying. I should also continue to balance my holdings between cash and stock, taking advantage of the 5% interest on cash while also capturing dividends from stocks.

My forecasting was off by a small margin in the practice rounds, and I will need to improve my accuracy to gain the additional cash rewards. I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my strategies as needed, especially as we get closer to the final rounds where the dynamics might shift due to the impending conversion of stocks to cash at the buyback rate.
