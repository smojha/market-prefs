During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with slight variations. In Round 1, the market price was 14, and in Round 2, it increased to 15, suggesting a potential upward trend or increased demand. My strategy of placing buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating a narrow trading range or cautious market behavior among participants. This aligns with the insight that the market may be anchored around the buyback price, as noted in the INSIGHTS.txt file.

The dividends and interest earned provided a steady income, which supports the strategy of holding some shares until the end to benefit from the buyback. My cash position increased from 100 to 125.97 over the three rounds due to dividends and interest, despite no trades being executed. This reinforces the importance of the dividend strategy mentioned in PLANS.txt.

Regarding forecasting, my predictions for future rounds were based on the observed trend and the potential for the market price to increase slightly above the buyback price. However, the accuracy of these forecasts will need to be monitored closely as the experiment progresses, as noted in the PLANS.txt file.

For the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue testing the market's response by adjusting my buy and sell order prices slightly to see if I can execute trades within the observed range. I will also maintain a strategy of holding some shares to the end to capitalize on the buyback price while using the dividends and interest to increase my cash position. Additionally, I will refine my forecasts based on the trends observed during the practice rounds, keeping in mind the potential volatility indicated by the limit order range.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the effectiveness of my initial strategies. I will continue to adapt and refine these strategies as I move into the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
