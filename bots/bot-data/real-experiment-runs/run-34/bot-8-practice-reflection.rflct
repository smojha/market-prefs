During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14.0 and increased to 15.0, which suggests a slight upward trend. My orders to buy at 13.0 and sell at 15.0 did not execute, indicating that my limit prices were not competitive enough to engage with the market dynamics effectively. This has led me to realize the importance of adjusting my order limits to be more aggressive to increase the likelihood of executing trades and gaining further insights into market behavior.

My strategy of holding onto the initial 4 shares of stock has been beneficial as I earned dividends, which, combined with the interest from cash, increased my cash balance from 100 to 125.97 over the practice rounds. This approach has been profitable given the dividends and interest earned, but I need to consider whether holding more or fewer stocks would optimize my earnings, especially as the market price approaches or exceeds the buyback value of 14.0.

In terms of price forecasting, my predictions have been generally accurate, staying within the reward range for the immediate and near-term forecasts. However, for longer-term forecasts (5 and 10 periods ahead), I need to refine my approach to account for potential market shifts and volatility.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to adjust my strategies based on these insights. I will submit more aggressive buy and sell orders to better engage with the market, continue to refine my price forecasts to maximize forecast winnings, and experiment with different allocations between stock and cash to optimize my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds. Additionally, I will keep a close eye on the market price relative to the buyback value as the experiment nears its end to ensure I do not overpay for stocks that will be converted at a fixed rate.
