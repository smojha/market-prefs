During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price stabilized around the buyback price of 14, which indicates a general awareness among participants of the stock's end value. My strategy of placing buy orders slightly below the market price to test liquidity was unsuccessful, as no trades were executed. This suggests a cautious approach among traders, likely due to the knowledge of the guaranteed buyback price. The high dividend in the first round (4.0 from 4 shares) highlighted the potential profitability of holding stocks, which needs to be weighed against the steady 5% interest earned on cash each period. Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, especially as we approach the final rounds. If the market price dips below 14, buying more shares could be beneficial due to the dividend potential and the guaranteed buyback value. My forecasts will continue to be adjusted based on observed market trends and stability around the buyback price. In the main experiment, I will aim to balance my portfolio between stocks and cash, taking advantage of dividends while also securing interest earnings, and adapt my strategies based on market dynamics and participant behavior.
