During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly above the buyback price, suggesting a market that values the stock close to its future conversion value. My strategy of holding onto shares while attempting to buy more at a lower price did not result in any executed trades, indicating that other participants are likely holding onto their shares as well, possibly due to the potential dividends. This observation aligns with my insights that the market may be efficient in pricing the stock based on its future value and the attractive dividend yield.

For the next rounds, I plan to continue holding my shares to benefit from the dividends, which have provided a steady income alongside the interest from my cash reserves. However, as we approach the end of the experiment, I will need to be more aggressive in selling shares if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price to maximize my earnings before the automatic conversion at the end. This strategy will need to be adjusted based on the behavior of other participants and the overall market dynamics.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging. I will continue to refine my forecasting model, taking into account the trends observed during the practice rounds, to potentially earn additional cash rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in shaping my approach to balancing the benefits of holding stock for dividends and interest from cash, while preparing to adapt my strategy as the experiment progresses towards its conclusion.
