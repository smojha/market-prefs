During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock fluctuated between 14 and 15, which aligns with my initial insights about the market's equilibrium around the buyback price of 14. My strategy of selling a share at 14 in the first round and attempting to buy back at 14 in the second round was based on maintaining a balance between cash and stocks, considering the 5% interest on cash and the potential dividends from stocks. The decision to sell at 14 was beneficial as it was executed at the market price, and holding cash earned me additional interest. However, my attempt to buy back at 14 in the second round was not executed, indicating that the market price had risen to 15, which was above my limit order. This suggests a need to be more flexible with buy orders to ensure execution, especially if the market price is trending upwards.

My price forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for the main experiment. However, I need to refine these forecasts further by considering not only recent trends but also potential impacts of dividend announcements and overall market sentiment. As we approach the end of the 30 rounds, the strategy of buying stocks at or below the buyback price becomes crucial to maximize returns, given that stocks will be converted at 14 regardless of the market price in the last round.

For the main experiment, I will continue to monitor market reactions closely, adjust my price forecasts based on broader market data, and strategically time my trades to optimize my portfolio. I will also keep a close eye on dividend payouts to better assess the trade-off between holding stocks for potential high dividends and holding cash for guaranteed interest. The insights gained from these practice rounds will be invaluable in adapting my strategies as the market dynamics evolve throughout the experiment.
