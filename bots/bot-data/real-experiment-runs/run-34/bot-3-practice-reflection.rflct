During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. In the first round, I attempted to buy at the market price but did not execute any trades, which suggests a cautious approach to entering the market. By the second round, I successfully purchased an additional share at a slightly higher price of 15, indicating a willingness to pay above the buyback price, possibly due to the potential for dividend earnings and the observed market trend. My strategy of testing the market's willingness to sell at higher prices by submitting a buy order slightly above the last market price and a sell order at a higher price seems effective for gauging market dynamics and liquidity. As I move into the main experiment, I will continue to refine this approach, focusing on securing stocks at or below the buyback price as the end of the experiment nears to maximize my earnings. The insights from the practice rounds have highlighted the importance of adapting to market conditions and other participants' behaviors, which I will keep in mind throughout the main rounds. Additionally, my price forecasts will need to be adjusted based on the trends observed, aiming to stay within the 2.5-unit range of the actual prices to earn the forecasting rewards.
