During the practice rounds, I tested three main strategies: holding, buying more shares, and considering selling to hold cash. The market price remained stable, fluctuating slightly between 14 and 15, which is close to the buyback price of 14. This stability suggests a cautious approach among participants, likely due to the proximity of the buyback price and the potential for dividends and interest earnings.

The 'Hold Strategy' allowed me to earn consistent dividends and interest, which increased my cash from 100 to 125.97 over the three rounds. This strategy seems viable as it provides a steady income without risking capital on potentially unfavorable trades. However, the effectiveness of this strategy will need to be reassessed as we approach round 30, considering the fixed buyback price.

The 'Buy More Strategy' did not result in any executed trades as my buy orders at 14 were not filled. This indicates that other participants were not willing to sell at or below this price, possibly due to the anticipation of higher dividends or a rise in market price. For future rounds, I might need to adjust my buy orders to cross the spread if I believe the stock's value will increase or if I want to secure more dividend income.

The 'Sell and Hold Cash Strategy' was not implemented during the practice rounds, but it remains a potential strategy if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price. This could be beneficial if I anticipate a market downturn or if I believe the interest earned on cash will outweigh potential stock gains.

My forecasts were generally accurate, staying within the 2.5-unit range of the actual market prices. This suggests a good understanding of market trends, which will be crucial for earning additional cash through accurate predictions in the main experiment.

Moving forward, I need to remain flexible and adapt my strategies based on market dynamics and my forecasts. As we approach round 30, the decision to buy or sell will become more critical due to the fixed buyback price. Balancing the steady income from dividends and interest with potential capital gains or losses will be key to maximizing my earnings at the end of the experiment.
