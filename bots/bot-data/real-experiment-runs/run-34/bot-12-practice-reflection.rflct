In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14.0 and increased to 15.0 by the second round, which suggests a potential upward trend in stock valuation. My strategy of submitting buy orders at or below the market price and sell orders slightly above did not result in any executed trades, indicating a need to adjust my order placement strategy to better align with market dynamics. The dividends and interest earned have incrementally increased my cash holdings, which is beneficial for maintaining liquidity and flexibility in trading.

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of the buyback price of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment. This value is crucial for long-term strategy, especially as we approach the final rounds. It suggests that buying stocks above this price near the end could be risky unless I am confident in selling them at a higher market price before the experiment concludes.

For future rounds, I plan to refine my approach by:
1. Adjusting my buy and sell orders to be more competitive, potentially crossing the spread to ensure trades are executed.
2. Continuously monitoring the market price and adjusting my forecasts accordingly, using the data from the practice rounds to inform these predictions.
3. Balancing my portfolio to optimize the benefits from both stock dividends and cash interest, while keeping the buyback price in mind.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in understanding the market's behavior and refining my trading and forecasting strategies. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment to maximize my total earnings.
