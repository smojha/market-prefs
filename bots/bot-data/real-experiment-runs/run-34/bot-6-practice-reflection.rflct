During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price stabilized around the buyback price of 14, suggesting that this value might serve as an anchor for trading decisions. In the first round, despite setting a buy order at the market price and a sell order slightly above it, no trades were executed, indicating low market liquidity. This trend continued into the second round, where my attempt to buy at a lower price and sell at the current market price also resulted in no trades. This suggests that other participants might be similarly cautious, possibly due to the proximity of the market price to the buyback value.

My strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stock has been beneficial, as evidenced by the steady increase in my cash holdings due to interest and dividends. The dividends earned from stocks have been consistent, aligning with the expected range of 0.4 to 1.0 per share, which supports the strategy of holding stocks for dividend income.

Regarding price forecasting, my predictions were off by small margins, which indicates a need for refinement. The market's stability around the buyback price should be considered more heavily in future forecasts, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.

As we move forward, I plan to continue testing market liquidity by adjusting my order spread, but also be more aggressive in buying stocks if the price drops below the buyback value to capitalize on potential gains at the end of the experiment. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting model to better predict market movements based on the observed trends and the impact of the buyback price. The insights gained from these practice rounds will be crucial in adapting my strategies for the main experiment rounds.
