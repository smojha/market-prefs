During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the stock's buyback value of 14, which aligns with my initial insights and supports my planned strategies. My 'Hold Strategy' seems viable as holding onto the shares provided consistent dividends, which, combined with the 5% interest on cash, could lead to steady growth. The 'Trading Strategy' of buying below 14 and selling above 14 was not executed due to no trades being filled, suggesting that the market was not volatile enough during the practice rounds to benefit from this approach. However, this strategy remains potentially profitable if market conditions change and price movements become more pronounced. The 'Mixed Strategy' of dynamically switching between holding and trading based on market conditions and forecasts is promising but requires careful monitoring and quick adaptation to be effective. My forecasts were slightly off, indicating a need for more accurate predictions to earn the forecasting rewards. Moving forward into the main experiment, I will continue to refine these strategies, paying close attention to market trends and other participants' behaviors. I will also ensure that my trades near the end of the experiment are timed to maximize the conversion value of stocks to cash at the buyback price of 14.
