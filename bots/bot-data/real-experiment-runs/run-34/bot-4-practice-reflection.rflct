During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the dynamics of the market price relative to the buyback value of the stock, which is set at 14. My strategy revolved around attempting to buy stocks at prices below this value to ensure a profit at the end of the experiment. However, my buy orders at 13 were not executed, indicating that the market price did not fall to this level during the practice rounds. This suggests that other participants are also aware of the buyback value and are not willing to sell below it, which could make it challenging to acquire stocks at a price that guarantees a profit at the end of the experiment.

The increase in market price from 14 to 15 over the practice rounds indicates a potential upward trend or at least a stabilization above the buyback price. This trend suggests that selling stocks at a higher price could be beneficial, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. My sell order at 15 in the second practice round was not executed, which might imply that other participants are holding onto their stocks, possibly anticipating even higher prices or aiming to collect dividends.

The dual income streams from cash interest and stock dividends played a crucial role in my strategy. I maintained a balance between cash and stocks to leverage both, which resulted in a steady increase in my cash balance due to interest and dividends. This approach aligns with my plan to balance the potential for capital gains from stocks with the steady income from cash.

My forecasts were based on slight increments over the current market price, which did not always align closely with the actual outcomes. This indicates a need for more refined forecasting methods, possibly incorporating more historical data and market trends.

Moving forward, I will continue to monitor the market closely, especially around the buyback price. I will adjust my buying strategy if the market price consistently stays above 14, potentially buying at slightly higher prices if the trend suggests further increases. Selling will be considered if the price rises significantly above 14, particularly as the experiment nears its end. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting approach by analyzing more data to improve accuracy and increase my chances of earning the forecast rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of adaptability in strategy. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on optimizing my portfolio to maximize earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
