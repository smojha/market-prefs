More aggressive trading may be necessary to execute trades, but caution remains essential, particularly near the end of the experiment to avoid overpaying for stocks. The balance between holding cash for interest and stocks for dividends continues to be crucial, requiring flexibility in strategy to adapt to market changes and the proximity to the buyback price. Accurate forecasting is key to earning additional rewards, necessitating close attention to market trends and adjustments as needed.",

It is evident that holding onto shares until the last round is risky, and selling them at a price slightly above the buyback rate is a safer strategy to maximize earnings. The lack of executed trades in the past rounds indicates a need for more aggressive selling to ensure liquidity.",
