Holding a majority of cash has been beneficial due to the interest earned, but buying stocks at a lower price could still be profitable if the price rebounds. The proximity to the buyback price adds a strategic layer to decision-making, as stocks bought above this price risk a loss at the end of the experiment. Therefore, a cautious approach to buying stocks is necessary, balancing potential gains against the risk of holding stocks near the end.",
