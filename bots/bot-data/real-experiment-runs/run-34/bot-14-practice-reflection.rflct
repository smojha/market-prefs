During the practice rounds, I observed the market dynamics and adjusted my strategies accordingly. Starting with an initial portfolio of 100 units of cash and 4 stocks, I managed to increase my stock holdings to 5 shares by the end of the second practice round, while maintaining a healthy cash reserve. The market price fluctuated from 14 to 15, and I successfully bought an additional share at the lower price of 14 in the first round, which was beneficial given the potential for dividends and the guaranteed buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment.

Key insights from these rounds include the importance of timing my purchases to optimize the balance between cash and stock holdings. The interest earned on cash (5% per period) provides a steady return, which supports maintaining a cash reserve. However, the potential for high dividends (up to 1.0 per share) and the guaranteed buyback price make stock holdings attractive, especially when the market price is at or below the buyback price.

My strategy moving forward will be to continue monitoring the market closely, aiming to buy stocks when the price is at or below 14, especially if there is a likelihood of high dividends. I will keep a sufficient cash reserve to capitalize on potential dips in the stock price and to ensure flexibility in my trading decisions. Additionally, I will continue to refine my forecasting approach based on observed market trends to potentially earn the forecasting rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the viability of a balanced approach between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends and the final buyback, with adjustments based on real-time market conditions.
