During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable at 14 in the first round and slightly increased to 15 in the second round, which aligns closely with the buyback price of 14. This suggests that the market may be gravitating towards an equilibrium near the buyback value, which is crucial for decision-making as we approach the end of the experiment. My strategy of setting limit orders to sell at a slightly higher price (15) and buy at a lower price (13) did not result in any trades, indicating that other participants were either setting similar or more aggressive limits. This highlights the need to perhaps adjust my trading strategy to be more competitive in order to execute trades.

The dividends earned from holding stock were consistent at 4.0 per round, reinforcing the value of holding onto shares for dividend income. Additionally, the interest earned on cash (5.0 in round 1 and 5.45 in round 2) underscores the importance of maintaining a balance between cash and stock to maximize returns from both dividends and interest.

My price forecasts were slightly off, with the actual market price being within 1 unit of my predictions for rounds 1 and 2. This suggests that my forecasting method needs refinement to consistently earn the forecasting rewards, which could significantly boost my total earnings.

Moving forward, I need to closely monitor market trends and adjust my strategies dynamically. Specifically, I should consider:
1. Adjusting my limit order prices to be more competitive and potentially cross the spread to ensure trades are executed.
2. Continuing to hold a portion of my portfolio in stock to benefit from dividends while also keeping enough cash to take advantage of interest earnings and potential buying opportunities.
3. Refining my price forecasting model using the historical data from these practice rounds to improve accuracy and increase the likelihood of earning forecasting rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and the effectiveness of my initial strategies. I will use these learnings to adapt and optimize my approach for the main experiment rounds.
