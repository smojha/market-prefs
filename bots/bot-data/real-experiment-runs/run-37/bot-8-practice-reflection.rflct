During the practice rounds, I have focused on monitoring market trends and adjusting my strategies accordingly. I have also actively participated in making price forecasts to potentially earn additional rewards. Moving forward, I plan to continue this approach and ensure that I strike a balance between buying stock and holding onto cash for investment purposes. It's essential to adapt to changing market dynamics and make informed decisions to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
