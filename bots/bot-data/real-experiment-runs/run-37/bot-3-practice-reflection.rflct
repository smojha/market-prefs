During the practice rounds, I have focused on observing market dynamics, adjusting my strategies based on price movements and dividend payouts, and prioritizing diversification and risk management in my trading decisions. I have also learned the importance of staying proactive in adapting my strategies to changing market conditions to optimize my earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue implementing these strategies while also considering the trade-in value for STOCK and making informed decisions on whether to buy STOCK at the current market price.
