In reviewing my plans and insights, I realize that I need to focus on diversifying my portfolio further by buying more stocks. I also need to pay attention to market trends to make more informed trading decisions. Looking at my past trading history, I see that I have been actively participating in trading activities and making submissions regularly, which is a positive sign. However, I need to be more strategic in my buy and sell orders to optimize my earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue actively participating in the trading rounds, diversifying my portfolio, and staying informed about market trends to make more profitable trading decisions.
