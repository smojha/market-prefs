In the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue testing both conservative and aggressive strategies as outlined in my previous plans. I will closely monitor market dynamics and participant behaviors to inform my decision-making process. I also need to be prepared to switch between strategies based on the prevailing market conditions to optimize my earnings. Considering the current market price and the trade-in value for stock, I will carefully evaluate whether it is beneficial to buy more stock at this price. Overall, I aim to stay flexible and adapt my tactics to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
