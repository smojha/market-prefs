During the practice rounds, I have continued to test my strategy of selling stock when the dividend is low and buying back when the market price is favorable. I have also started to explore the incorporation of market price trends into my decision-making process to maximize earnings. I have realized the importance of adapting strategies based on market conditions and accurate price forecasting to earn additional rewards. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies and adapt them as needed to optimize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
