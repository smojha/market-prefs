Based on my past experiences and the current market conditions, I realize the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to my trading strategy. I will continue to monitor market trends, make informed decisions on buying and selling stocks, and focus on improving my price forecasting accuracy. Additionally, I will consider the potential impact of market volatility on my portfolio and aim to adapt my strategies accordingly. Ultimately, my goal is to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
