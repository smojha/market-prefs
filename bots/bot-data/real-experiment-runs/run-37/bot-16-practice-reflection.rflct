During the practice rounds, I have found that my strategy of holding onto my current stock and potential buying more at low market prices has been effective. I have also realized the importance of balancing between holding onto stock for dividends and buying more at favorable prices to maximize earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue with this strategy while also closely monitoring market trends and dividend payouts to make informed trading decisions. I will also consider adjusting my strategy based on any new insights or data that may come up during the main experiment rounds.
