During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of timing in trading and the need to make quick decisions based on market conditions. I have also realized the significance of taking risks when necessary to maximize profits. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on my strategy of buying low and selling high while closely monitoring market trends. Additionally, I will pay attention to the possibility of stock termination at a lower value and consider the trade-in amount after the last round to make informed decisions. Overall, I will strive to adapt my strategies as needed to enhance my earnings in the upcoming experiment rounds.
