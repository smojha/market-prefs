After reviewing my past strategies and results, I have noticed that accurately forecasting the market price has been beneficial in earning rewards. Holding onto the stock to earn dividends and considering the buyback price have also been effective strategies for maximizing my earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue with these strategies while also keeping an eye out for opportunities to capitalize on market fluctuations. Additionally, I will be more mindful of setting advantageous buy and sell prices to optimize my portfolio performance.
