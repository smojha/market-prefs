During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of adjusting my buy and sell limit prices based on market trends and potential dividends. I have also realized the value of holding onto stocks for longer periods to maximize dividend earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue implementing these strategies and also focus on staying patient with my trading decisions, staying informed about market conditions, and adapting my strategies as needed. Overall, I aim to continue learning and refining my trading skills to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
