During the practice rounds, I have experimented with more aggressive buying and selling strategies to take advantage of market fluctuations. I have also focused on diversifying my portfolio to mitigate risks. I have noticed that staying adaptable and making strategic decisions based on current market conditions is crucial. Diversification has indeed helped me manage risks and optimize earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue testing these strategies while also paying close attention to market trends and adjusting my approach accordingly.
