During these practice rounds, I have learned the importance of monitoring market trends, maximizing dividend earnings from stock, and adapting strategies to maximize overall earnings. I have also realized the significance of accurate price forecasting as it can impact the buying and selling decisions. Moving forward, I plan to continue focusing on these key areas and refining my strategies to achieve optimal results in the upcoming trading periods.
