Based on my experience in the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of monitoring market trends and adjusting trading strategies accordingly. I have also seen the impact of strategic order submissions on overall earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue implementing these strategies while also exploring different price points for buy and sell orders to optimize profits. Additionally, I will focus on improving my price forecasting accuracy to earn rewards and maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
