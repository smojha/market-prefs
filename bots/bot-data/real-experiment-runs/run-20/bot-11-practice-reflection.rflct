Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and lessons learned:

1. Fundamental Value Analysis:
- Each share provides expected dividend of 0.7 per period (avg of 0.4 and 1.0)
- Terminal value is fixed at 14 per share
- Market price has been ranging from 14-15, which appears fair to slightly undervalued

2. Order Strategy Insights:
- My passive orders (buy 13-14, sell 15-16) weren't getting filled, suggesting I need to be more aggressive to execute
- Important to cross the spread when necessary to establish positions
- Should consider placing multiple orders at different price points to increase fill probability

3. Portfolio Management:
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends
- Current portfolio of 4 shares seems reasonable given the risk/reward
- Having cash buffer provides flexibility for opportunities

4. Price Forecasting:
- My forecasts trended upward (14 to 18) reflecting expected value appreciation
- Need to consider both fundamental value and market psychology
- Important to stay within 2.5 unit range of actual price for rewards

5. Key Strategy for Main Experiment:
- Focus on fundamental value as anchor for trading decisions
- Be more aggressive with order pricing when conviction is high
- Maintain balanced portfolio between cash and stock
- Monitor price trends and adjust strategy accordingly
- Consider terminal value of 14 when trading near end of experiment
