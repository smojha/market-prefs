Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Price Stability: The market price has remained relatively stable between 14-15, which is close to the fundamental buyback value of 14. This suggests participants are pricing the stock rationally.

2. Order Execution: My limit orders (Buy @ 14, Sell @ 16) weren't executed in the practice rounds, indicating I may need to be more aggressive in pricing to get fills. The spread might need to be tightened.

3. Portfolio Growth: My cash position grew from 106.6 to 123.21 over the practice rounds through dividend payments (1.6 per round) and interest earnings (around 5-5.33 per round), showing the power of holding both assets.

4. Strategy Adjustment: For the main experiment, I should:
   - Place orders closer to the market price to increase execution probability
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio to benefit from both dividend payments and interest
   - Consider selling some shares if price rises significantly above 14 (buyback value)
   - Focus on accumulating shares when price drops below 14

5. Price Forecasting: My forecasts were consistently close to the actual prices (14-15 range), suggesting the market may maintain stability around the fundamental value. I should continue this conservative forecasting approach to earn the bonus rewards.
