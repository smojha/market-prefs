Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons and strategies I've identified:

1. Order Execution Strategy:
- The market appears to have relatively low trading volume (0-2 trades per period)
- Wide bid-ask spreads suggest need to be more aggressive with limit order prices to get fills
- Consider placing multiple orders at different price points to increase execution probability

2. Price Analysis:
- Market price has been relatively stable between 14-15, close to the terminal value of 14
- This suggests market is pricing shares fairly given remaining dividends and terminal value
- Need to be especially careful buying above 14 in later rounds due to terminal conversion

3. Portfolio Management:
- Successfully increased share position from 4 to 6 shares early on
- Cash position remains healthy at 92.21, providing buffer for opportunities
- Getting both dividend income (2.4 per round) and interest income (3.5-3.8 per round)

4. Forecasting:
- Price forecasts have been conservative and close to actual prices
- Maintaining forecasts within 2.5 unit range to earn forecast rewards
- Expect prices to gradually trend toward terminal value of 14

5. Going Forward:
- Focus on buying below 14 when possible
- Consider selling shares priced significantly above fundamental value
- Maintain balanced portfolio between cash and shares to earn both interest and dividends
- Be more aggressive with limit order prices to ensure execution in low volume market
