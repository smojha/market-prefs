Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Dynamics:
- The market price has been relatively stable between 14-15, suggesting participants are anchoring around the buyback value of 14
- Trading volume is very low (0-2 trades per round), indicating participants are being cautious

2. Value Assessment:
- The fundamental value per share can be calculated as:
  * Expected dividend per round: (0.4 + 1.0)/2 = 0.7
  * Remaining rounds Ã— 0.7 + Buyback value of 14
- When price is above 14, need to carefully consider whether additional dividend earnings justify the premium over buyback value

3. Strategy Effectiveness:
- My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15-16 (sell) didn't execute, suggesting I need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to execute trades
- The 5% interest on cash provides a reliable return floor - earned 5.0 and 5.33 in first two rounds
- Dividend earnings (1.6 per round) have been consistent with low dividend outcomes

4. Forward Strategy:
- Focus on getting trades executed by placing orders closer to market price
- Consider reducing stock position if price rises significantly above 14 since downside risk increases
- Maintain cash reserves both for 5% interest and to take advantage of any price drops below fundamental value
- Be more precise with price forecasts by staying within 2.5 units of current price trends
