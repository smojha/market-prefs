Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Price Stability: The market price has been relatively stable between 14-15, which seems reasonable given:
   - The guaranteed buyback value of 14
   - Expected dividend of 0.7 per period
   - 5% interest rate on cash

2. Trading Strategy Effectiveness:
   - My limit orders were conservative (buy at 13-14, sell at 15-16)
   - Low trading volume suggests other traders are also being cautious
   - May need to adjust order prices closer to market to increase execution probability

3. Portfolio Performance:
   - Maintained initial 4 shares while growing cash position
   - Cash grew from 100 to 123.21 through dividends and interest
   - Conservative approach provided steady returns

4. Lessons for Main Experiment:
   - Consider more aggressive order placement to ensure execution
   - Pay attention to remaining periods when valuing shares
   - Keep some cash reserve for opportunities
   - Monitor dividend patterns for potential impact on price
   - Be particularly careful with prices above 14 in later rounds

Overall, the practice rounds suggest a balanced approach between holding shares for dividends and maintaining cash for interest/opportunities is viable.
