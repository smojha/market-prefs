After analyzing the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Dynamics:
- The market price has been relatively stable around 14-15, close to the terminal value of 14
- Trading volume has been low (0-2 shares per round), suggesting limited market liquidity
- Other traders seem hesitant to cross the spread, as my orders weren't executed

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position grew steadily from 106.6 to 123.21 through interest (5%) and dividends
- Maintaining 4 shares provided steady dividend income (either 0.4 or 1.0 per share)
- Combined return from interest and dividends provided good baseline earnings

3. Strategy Assessment:
- Order placement strategy (buy orders 1-2 below market, sell orders 1-2 above) may need adjustment to get executions
- May need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread when wanting to execute trades
- Current portfolio balance (4 shares, ~123 cash) seems reasonable for diversified returns

4. Forward-Looking Considerations:
- Should avoid buying above 14 as we get closer to experiment end due to terminal value
- Need to balance potential dividend earnings vs guaranteed 5% interest on cash
- Consider gradually reducing stock position if prices rise significantly above 14

These lessons will guide my trading strategy in the main experiment rounds.
