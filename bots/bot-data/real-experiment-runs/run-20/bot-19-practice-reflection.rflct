Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and strategy adjustments for the main experiment:

1. Market Price Stability:
- The market has been relatively stable around 14-15, close to the buyback value of 14
- Low trading volume suggests participants are being cautious and rational about prices

2. Order Strategy:
- My conservative approach with orders on both sides was appropriate but may need tighter spreads
- Should place buy orders closer to market price (14-14.5) to increase execution probability
- Will maintain sell orders slightly above market but below 16 to ensure fills

3. Portfolio Management:
- Current position of 4 shares seems reasonable given dividend income potential
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends (0.4-1.0)
- Will maintain cash reserves for opportunistic buying if prices drop below 14

4. Value Analysis:
- Each share provides expected dividend of 0.7 per period
- With 14 buyback value, any price above 15-16 appears expensive
- Focus on buying below 14 when possible to guarantee positive return

5. Risk Management:
- Important to reduce share position as we approach round 30
- Must ensure ability to sell shares above 14 before final buyback
- Will maintain balanced position between cash and shares

Main Strategy for Experiment:
Buy opportunistically below 14, sell gradually above 15, maintain flexibility with cash position, and adjust position size based on remaining periods.
