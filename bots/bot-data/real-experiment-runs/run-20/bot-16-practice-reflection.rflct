Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Behavior:
- The market price has been relatively stable around 14-15, which is rational given the terminal value of 14
- Trading volume has been low (0-2 shares per round), suggesting participants are being cautious

2. Trading Strategy Performance:
- My limit orders with spreads of 2-3 units from market price didn't execute, suggesting I need to tighten spreads
- The steady accumulation of cash from interest (5%) and dividends (1.6 per round for 4 shares) shows the value of holding both assets

3. Key Learnings:
- The fundamental value calculation is critical: 14 (terminal) + (remaining periods Ã— 0.7 avg dividend)
- Need to balance guaranteed 5% interest on cash vs variable dividends on stock
- Should place orders closer to market price to increase execution probability
- Important to maintain flexibility in holdings as we approach terminal period

4. Strategy Adjustments for Main Experiment:
- Use tighter bid-ask spreads (1-1.5 units) around market price
- Consider selling shares above 14 when possible, especially later in experiment
- Maintain cash reserves to earn interest and have buying power
- Focus more on price forecasting to earn additional rewards

Overall, the practice rounds demonstrate the importance of understanding fundamental value and being patient with order execution while managing the cash-stock balance.
