Based on my practice experience, here are the key learnings and strategies I plan to implement in the main experiment:

1. Value Analysis:
- The fundamental value of stock comes from both dividends (0.7 expected per period) and the final buyback value (14)
- As we get closer to round 30, the stock value should converge to 14 since fewer dividend payments remain
- Need to be especially careful not to overpay for stock in later rounds

2. Trading Strategy:
- Market price has been relatively stable around 14-15, suggesting other participants understand the fundamental value
- My limit orders at 13-14 for buying and 15-16 for selling were not executed, indicating I may need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to execute trades
- Important to maintain balance between earning 5% interest on cash and potential dividend returns from stock

3. Portfolio Management:
- Starting position of 4 stocks seems reasonable to maintain given dividend potential
- Current cash position (~123) provides good buffer for opportunistic trading while earning interest
- Will avoid getting overexposed to stock, especially as we approach final rounds

4. Price Forecasting:
- My forecasts of 14-15 have been reasonable given observed price stability
- Need to factor in declining fundamental value over time due to fewer remaining dividend payments
- Important to consider both immediate market dynamics and longer-term convergence to buyback price

5. Risk Management:
- Critical to maintain enough cash for attractive buying opportunities
- Never risk buying above 14 in later rounds since that guarantees losses at buyback
- Monitor other participants' behavior for potential market inefficiencies to exploit
