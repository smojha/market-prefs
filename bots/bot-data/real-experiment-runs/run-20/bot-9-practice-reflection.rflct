After analyzing the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Behavior:
- The market price has been relatively stable between 14-15, which is close to the fundamental value considering the 14 buyback price.
- Trading volume has been low (0-2 trades per round), suggesting participants are being cautious.

2. Order Execution:
- My limit orders with wider spreads (13-15, 14-16) didn't execute, indicating I need to tighten spreads to increase execution probability.
- Being too conservative with order prices may result in missed trading opportunities.

3. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position has grown steadily from 106.6 to 123.21 due to interest (5%) and dividends (avg 1.6 per round).
- Holding 4 shares provided consistent dividend income without taking trading risks.

4. Strategy Adjustments for Main Experiment:
- Focus on placing orders closer to current market price to improve execution chances.
- Consider the combined value of dividends (0.7 expected) and interest (5%) when making trading decisions.
- Be more aggressive in selling above 14 as we approach later rounds.
- Monitor price trends more closely to identify profitable trading opportunities.
- Balance the guaranteed returns from interest against potential trading profits.

Reminder: Keep in mind that any stock holdings will be converted to 14 cash per share at experiment end, so avoid overpaying for shares especially in later rounds.
