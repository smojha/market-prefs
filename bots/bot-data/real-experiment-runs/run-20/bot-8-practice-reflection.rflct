Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons learned:

1. Market Price vs. Fundamental Value:
- The market price has been hovering around 14-15, which is at or slightly above the terminal value of 14
- Need to be very careful about buying above 14 as we approach the end since shares will be converted at 14 regardless of market price

2. Income Streams Analysis:
- Each share provides expected dividend of 0.7 per period (average of 0.4 and 1.0)
- Cash provides guaranteed 5% interest
- For 4 shares, I'm earning about 2.8 in expected dividends vs. 5-6 in interest on my cash

3. Trading Strategy Insights:
- My limit orders weren't executed because they weren't aggressive enough - may need to cross the spread more
- Important to maintain flexibility with both cash and shares to take advantage of opportunities
- Should focus on buying when price drops below 14 and selling above, especially as we get closer to the end

4. Risk Management:
- Having 4 shares seems like a good balanced position - provides dividend income while keeping enough cash for interest and opportunities
- Need to be more careful about price forecasts - they should generally trend toward the terminal value of 14 in later rounds

5. Future Focus:
- Will look for opportunities to buy below 14 and sell above
- Need to be more aggressive with order prices to get executions
- Will adjust forecasts to reflect terminal value convergence
- Important to track other traders' behavior as they may create opportunities through suboptimal decisions
