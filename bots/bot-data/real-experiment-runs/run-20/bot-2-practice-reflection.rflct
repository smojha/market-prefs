Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Price Dynamics:
- Market prices have been relatively stable around 14-15, close to the final buyback value of 14
- This suggests other traders are aware of fundamental value

2. Trading Strategy:
- I've been appropriately conservative with orders, placing buys below market (13-14) and sells above (15-16)
- While orders weren't filled, this disciplined approach protects from overpaying
- Will continue to avoid buying above 14 near experiment end due to buyback risk

3. Portfolio Management:
- Current portfolio (4 shares, 123.21 cash) provides good balance
- Earning both dividends (avg 0.7 per share) and interest (5% on cash)
- Having both assets provides flexibility to capitalize on opportunities

4. Market Behavior:
- Low trading volume (0-2) indicates careful trading by participants
- May need to adjust bid-ask spreads to increase execution probability

5. Forecasting:
- My price forecasts (14-15) have been reasonable given observed prices
- Should continue forecasting near fundamental value while accounting for short-term momentum

Key Lessons:
1. Focus on fundamental value (dividends + buyback)
2. Be patient with order execution
3. Maintain balanced portfolio for consistent returns
4. Consider narrowing bid-ask spreads if needed for execution
5. Stay particularly alert to price versus buyback value in later rounds
