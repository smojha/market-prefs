Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Behavior:
- The market price has remained relatively stable between 14-15, close to the final buyback value of 14
- Trading volume has been low (0-2 trades per round), suggesting potential liquidity issues
- Need to place orders closer to market price to increase execution probability

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position has grown steadily from 106.6 to 123.21 due to interest (5%) and dividends
- No trades were executed despite placing both buy and sell orders, likely due to spread being too wide
- Current portfolio of 4 shares and 123.21 cash provides good balance of dividend income and interest earnings

3. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Tighten bid-ask spreads (e.g., buy at 13.5-14 and sell at 14.5-15) to improve execution chances
- Focus on accumulating shares when price is below 14 (buyback value)
- Consider selling shares above 14 to lock in profits, especially in later rounds
- Account for both dividend income (0.7 expected per round) and interest earnings (5%) when making decisions
- Keep cash reserves for opportunistic buying while earning interest

Key lesson: Need to be more aggressive with order pricing while maintaining a balanced portfolio that generates both dividend and interest income.
