Across the three practice rounds, my limit orders have not executed. In rounds 1 and 2, I attempted to buy 2 shares at 13 and sell 2 shares at 15, but the market prices were 14.5 and 15 respectively, resulting in no trades. In round 3, no orders were submitted. The market price has hovered around 14-15, suggesting a potential resistance around the fundamental value.  I need to further narrow the spread between buy and sell orders to facilitate trades and gain a better understanding of actual market behavior. My forecasting strategy currently anticipates the price converging towards 14, but this has not consistently occurred.  This requires further refinement in the experimental rounds.  Dividends and interest have steadily increased my cash holdings.
