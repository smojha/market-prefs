During the practice rounds, I have been testing my strategy of buying stocks when the market price is low and selling when it is high. This strategy has so far proven to be effective in generating dividends and increasing my overall earnings. Additionally, I have been focusing on improving my price forecasting techniques to enhance my accuracy in predicting market prices. It's crucial for me to remain adaptable in my trading strategies, considering market dynamics and adjusting as needed. Finding a balance between short-term dividends and long-term stock price appreciation will be key to maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
