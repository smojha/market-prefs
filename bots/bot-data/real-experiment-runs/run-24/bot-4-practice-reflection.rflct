During the practice rounds, I have been focusing on testing different trading strategies, particularly adjusting my limit prices for buying and selling stock. I have also been working on improving my price forecasting accuracy. One key insight I have gained is the importance of tracking the performance of different strategies in varying market conditions to identify the most profitable approaches. Additionally, I understand that consistent improvement in price forecasting can potentially lead to higher rewards. Moving forward, I plan to continue testing and refining my strategies to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
