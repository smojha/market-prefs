During the practice rounds, I observed that the market prices have been relatively stable, hovering around the 14.5 to 15.5 range. My initial strategy of submitting small buy and sell orders within a reasonable price range did not result in any executed trades, which suggests that the market might be cautious and conservative. The dividend earnings and interest on cash have been consistent, which adds a predictable element to my overall earnings. 

Key insights from the practice rounds include the importance of closely monitoring market trends and adjusting orders accordingly. The lack of executed trades indicates that my price ranges might need to be more competitive. Additionally, the forecasts I made were close to the actual market prices, highlighting the potential for earning additional cash through accurate predictions. 

For future rounds, I plan to continue experimenting with small trades but will consider adjusting my limit prices to align more closely with observed market dynamics. I will also focus on making more accurate forecasts to maximize my earnings from predictions. Overall, the practice rounds have been valuable in understanding the market behavior and refining my trading strategies.
