After analyzing the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Price vs. Fundamental Value:
- The market price has been hovering around 14.5-15, slightly above the final buyback value of 14
- This suggests other traders may be factoring in the dividend potential, but the premium seems small

2. Trading Strategy Assessment:
- My conservative limit orders (buy 13, sell 15-16) didn't execute, suggesting I need to be more aggressive to get fills
- Should consider narrowing the spread between buy/sell orders to increase execution probability

3. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends (mix of 0.4 and 1.0)
- Starting position of 4 shares seems reasonable to maintain given the dividend income

4. Future Strategy Adjustments:
- Will look to actively trade when prices deviate significantly from fundamental value
- Need to better calculate true fundamental value considering remaining dividends + final buyback
- Consider more market-making strategies with tighter spreads to capture small profits
- Important to maintain sufficient shares for dividend income while keeping cash for opportunities

5. Risk Management:
- Critical to avoid overpaying as round 30 approaches since shares convert to 14 regardless of market price
- Need to balance dividend potential against risk of holding overvalued shares at experiment end
