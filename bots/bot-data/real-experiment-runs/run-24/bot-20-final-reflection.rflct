Throughout the experiment, the strategy of holding cash and earning interest proved to be effective, especially as the end of the experiment approached and the market price converged towards the buyback price of 14. The consistent downward trend in the market price aligned with the strategy of avoiding new stock purchases and focusing on accurate price forecasting to maximize earnings from rewards. By the end of round 30, I had successfully sold all my shares, leaving me with a substantial amount of cash. The final cash amount of 710.02 units translates to a significant monetary reward, given the conversion rate of 200 CASH = $1 US. The participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus contributed to a total payment of $15.60. In future experiments, it would be beneficial to continue focusing on cash holdings and accurate forecasting, especially as the end of the trading periods nears. Additionally, considering the market dynamics and the behavior of other participants can help in making more informed decisions. Overall, the strategy of prioritizing cash holdings and accurate forecasting was successful in maximizing earnings.
