Across the three practice rounds, I observed a slightly upward trend in market price, starting at 14.5 and reaching 15.5.  My limit order strategy saw a successful sale in round 2 at 15, confirming that setting a slightly higher sell price can yield positive results in this environment. However, no buys were executed, suggesting a resistance to lower buy prices or a prevailing sentiment among other participants to hold stock. The low trading volume overall hints at a cautious market.  For the main experiment, I plan to continue testing limit orders with a wider spread initially to capture potential price fluctuations and gradually narrow it as I gather more information about market behavior. I will also experiment with holding a higher proportion of cash to capitalize on the consistent 5% interest while opportunistically buying shares when the price dips. My forecast strategy needs refinement, potentially by factoring in the upward price trend observed and considering how the dividend and interest rates influence price. Crucial for rounds approaching 30 will be remembering that stock will be bought back at 14, so avoiding purchases above that threshold is essential to avoid losses.
