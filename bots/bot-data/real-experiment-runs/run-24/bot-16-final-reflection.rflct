Throughout the experiment, I aimed to execute a pump-and-dump strategy to manipulate the market price and maximize my profits. Initially, I held onto my stocks, anticipating a rise in market price. As the price increased from 15.0 in Round 1 to a peak of 20.0 in Round 14, I refrained from selling, hoping to inflate the market further. However, I noticed that my submitted buy orders at lower prices were not executed, indicating a lack of willingness from other participants to sell at those prices, which limited my ability to increase my stock holdings and influence the market more aggressively.

In Round 20, I managed to buy one more share at 19.0, which was a strategic move to increase my holdings before the market started to decline. As the market price began to fall from 20.0 to 14.0, I sold my shares at 17.0 and 16.0 in Rounds 23 and 24, respectively, capitalizing on the peak values. By Round 25, I had sold all my shares, securing a significant amount of cash.

My strategy to inflate the market price was somewhat successful, as evidenced by the peak price of 20.0, but it did not reach the extreme levels I had hoped for to maximize the pump-and-dump effect. The market dynamics and the reluctance of other participants to engage in trades at my desired prices limited my ability to fully execute the strategy. In future experiments, a more aggressive approach to buying at lower prices and selling at the peak might be necessary to create a more significant bubble and profit from its collapse.

The final market price of 14.0 aligned with the buyback price, which meant that holding onto shares until the end would not have been beneficial. My decision to sell before the final round was correct, as it maximized my cash position to 686.95 units, resulting in a total payment of $15.58, including the participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus.

In conclusion, while I managed to profit from the strategy, a more effective execution of the pump-and-dump could have led to higher profits. Adapting to market dynamics and being more proactive in manipulating the market through aggressive buying and selling could enhance the success of such a strategy in future scenarios.
