During the practice rounds, I noticed that the market price for the stock has been relatively stable around 14-15, which is close to the buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment. This suggests that buying stock at prices around this range is a safe strategy to increase dividend earnings. However, it's important to keep a significant amount of cash to take advantage of future buying opportunities and to earn interest. In the first two practice rounds, my buy orders were not executed because the market price was slightly higher than my limit prices. This indicates that I might need to adjust my buy orders to be more competitive or consider the market dynamics more carefully. Additionally, my price forecasts were slightly optimistic, and I should consider being more conservative in my predictions to increase the likelihood of earning the forecast reward. Overall, the key is to balance the portfolio to maximize earnings from both dividends and interest on cash, while also paying attention to market trends and adjusting strategies as needed.
