Throughout the experiment, I focused on maintaining a conservative trading strategy, which allowed me to ensure cash protection. By keeping sales near the buyback price, I was able to mitigate potential losses as the market neared the final rounds. This strategy was effective in safeguarding my portfolio, especially towards the end where I successfully liquidated stock at or near the buyback value to avoid any termination losses. My forecasts were mostly accurate, earning a small bonus, thanks to adjustments based on current market conditions. However, the initial practice rounds emphasized the slow movement of assets and the importance of adapting strategies according to dynamic market behaviors. As the rounds progressed, the market became increasingly volatile, illustrating the necessity for timely adjustments and the balancing act between holding stock for dividends and liquidating for cash. Lessons learned include the critical evaluation of forecast accuracy, understanding market dynamics, and strategic order placements to optimize earnings. Despite the initial plan to employ a pump-and-dump strategy for large profits, the conservative approach better suited competition against unpredictable market influences and participant behaviors.
