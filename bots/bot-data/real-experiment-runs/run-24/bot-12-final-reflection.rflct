My overall strategy was to maximize cash holdings by round 30 to optimize the final payout.  Initially attempted to capitalize on market fluctuations in the early rounds by submitting limit buy and sell orders slightly outside the current market price. This strategy proved ineffective as the orders were rarely filled. After observing the market's upward trend, I shifted my strategy in round 7 to begin incrementally selling off shares as the price increased. This aimed to capitalize on the upward momentum and secure profits. By round 20, all shares were sold at a peak average price of 19.  From round 21 onward, the strategy focused on maintaining the elevated cash balance, achieved through previous share sales, and allowing interest to accumulate.  I attempted to capitalize on late-stage price drops with aggressive low buy orders, which were never filled, but would have optimized returns further if successful. The final strategy proved successful, yielding a cash balance of 690.2. Final observations: Early round attempts to profit off market fluctuations through buy/sell orders at or near market price were largely unsuccessful.  More aggressive buy/sell orders with larger spreads would likely have been more profitable, but potentially riskier. Successfully capitalized on overall market trend for price appreciation by beginning to liquidate shares as early as round 7.  This proved highly effective in maximizing cash well in advance of the 14 buyback in the final round and resulted in final earnings far exceeding what buy-and-hold or missed forecast bonuses would have provided.  This strategy did not require accurate forecasts or actively driving trading volume or market manipulation, instead opting to simply capitalize on general market trends to maximize returns from compounding interest over time.
