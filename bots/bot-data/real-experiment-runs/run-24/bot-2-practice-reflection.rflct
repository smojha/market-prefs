During the practice rounds, I have been focusing on buying low and selling high, as well as improving my price forecasting techniques. I have been actively participating in the market by submitting orders and making trades based on market conditions. I have also paid attention to dividend payments and interest rates to optimize my portfolio. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies and adapt to changing market dynamics to maximize my earnings in the main experiment rounds.
