During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 14.5 and 15.0, which is slightly above the buyback price of 14.00. This suggests that the market is valuing the stock at a slight premium. My initial strategy of conservative trading allowed me to gather valuable data on market dynamics and dividend payouts. However, I did not execute any trades, which means I missed out on potential dividend earnings. For future rounds, I plan to be more active in trading while still maintaining a balanced portfolio of cash and stocks. I will also refine my forecasting strategy to better predict market movements and adjust my orders accordingly. The practice rounds have been instrumental in understanding the market behavior and will help in developing a more robust strategy for the main experiment.
