During the practice rounds, I have focused on monitoring market trends closely and staying agile in my decision-making process. I have also been mindful of adjusting my portfolio allocation based on changing market conditions. One key insight I have gained is the importance of adaptability in response to evolving market dynamics and the significance of risk management in my trading strategies. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my strategies, especially in terms of forecast accuracy and optimizing my trading decisions to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
