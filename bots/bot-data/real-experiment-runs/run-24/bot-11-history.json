I will continue to observe market behavior and adapt my strategies during the main experiment. Successful trades at 15.0 in practice round 2 and main round 1 suggest potential for small profits around the buyback price. The low trading volume indicates there might not be a significant number of traders deviating significantly from the buyback price of 14, so I should aim for trades near to this price point unless the market clearly starts to trend upwards or downwards.",
