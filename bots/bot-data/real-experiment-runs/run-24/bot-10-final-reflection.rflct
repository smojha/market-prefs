My initial strategy involved establishing a baseline understanding of market behavior by observing price fluctuations and trading volumes during the practice rounds.  I aimed to identify patterns and predict future trends. I submitted limit orders to both buy and sell shares, strategically placing them near the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of execution.  My goal was to gradually accumulate shares at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on market volatility.  

As the experiment progressed, I refined my strategy by analyzing past market data and incorporating dividend and interest earnings into my decision-making. I observed that the market price tended to fluctuate within a certain range, and I adjusted my limit orders accordingly. In the mid-game, I focused on increasing my stock holdings, capitalizing on periods of lower prices to acquire more shares. 

Recognizing the final round conversion mechanic, I aimed to sell my entire stock holding before the end of the experiment to avoid the risk of the automatic conversion to a lower cash value. I submitted progressively lower sell orders to ensure successful transactions as the final round approached. Ultimately, I adopted a more aggressive trading approach in the later rounds, submitting larger buy and sell orders to maximize my returns. My final earnings reflect a combination of successful trades, dividend and interest income, and a strategic exit from the stock market before the final round conversion.
