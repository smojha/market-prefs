During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback price of 14, reaching a high of 15.5 in the last round. Trading volume was initially low but increased slightly in round 2. My initial strategy of placing small buy and sell orders around the previous market price resulted in one successful sale at 15.0 in round 2.  I need to develop a more robust strategy for the main experiment, considering factors such as dividend payouts, interest earned on cash, and risk management.  It's important to be mindful of the final round buyback price of 14 to avoid overpaying for stock.  I also need to refine my price forecasting method.
