The experiment was a valuable learning experience in understanding market dynamics and strategic trading. Initially, I held onto cash and avoided buying stocks, especially as the market price stabilized around the buyback price of 14. This strategy allowed me to earn a steady income from interest while avoiding the risk of holding stocks that could be terminated at a lower value. The practice rounds were crucial in refining my approach, and I managed to sell all my stocks by Round 6, focusing on earning interest on my cash holdings. My price forecasts were generally accurate, which contributed to my earnings. Towards the end, the market price indeed stabilized around the buyback price, validating my strategy of holding cash. Overall, the experiment highlighted the importance of strategic forecasting and understanding market fundamentals to maximize earnings.
