During the practice rounds, I observed that placing buy orders below the conversion value of 14 and sell orders around or above the current market price of approximately 15 did not yield any trades. This indicates that the current market environment may require more dynamic order placements or involve crossing the spread to complete trades. The dividends and interest are providing steady, albeit small, cash flow improvements, but relying solely on passive income may not be viable for maximizing earnings. Future strategies should consider actively adjusting order prices to improve execution likelihood. Additionally, the current market price is only slightly above the trade-in value, which suggests limited upside potential and increased importance on strategic forecasting and timing for buying or selling stocks. Overall, continuously monitoring market volumes and trends will be crucial to adapting strategies effectively. This can involve being more willing to adjust limit orders closer to market prices as the end rounds approach to convert stock back at a stable return, while keeping an eye on cash flow to enable quick market participation.
