Across the three practice rounds, my limit buy and sell orders have not been filled.  While round 1 saw a market price of 14.5 and zero volume, rounds 2 and 3 saw market prices of 15.0 and 15.5 respectively, with minimal, but non-zero volume. This strongly indicates that other participants are also setting limit orders outside of the 13.0 - 15.0 range I tested.  I need to be more aggressive with my limit orders to participate in trading.  It appears that the market may be overvaluing the stock relative to the buyback price of 14.  I also need to understand whether and when these experimental subjects' decision are consistent with the expected value of the underlying stock.

Key takeaways from practice rounds:

* **Need for more aggressive pricing:** The lack of filled orders necessitates adjusting limit order prices closer to the observed market prices to ensure participation in trades.
* **Potential overvaluation:** The consistent market prices above 14 suggest a possible overvaluation of the stock, especially considering the final buyback at 14.
* **Understanding other participants' behavior:** Further investigation is required to understand the decision-making processes of other participants and how their behavior influences market dynamics.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to implement the following adjustments:

* **Narrower limit order spread:**  Place limit buy orders just below and limit sell orders just above the previous round's market price to increase the likelihood of order execution.
* **Dynamic price adjustment:** Continuously monitor market prices and adjust limit orders based on observed trends and volumes.
* **Consider expected value:** Factor in the expected value of the stock, considering dividend payouts and the buyback price, when determining limit order prices.

By actively adapting to market dynamics and understanding other participants' behavior, I aim to optimize my trading strategy and maximize my earnings in the main experiment.
