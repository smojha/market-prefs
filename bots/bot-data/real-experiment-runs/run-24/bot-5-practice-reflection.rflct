During the practice rounds, I noticed that my submitted buy and sell orders had no executed trades. This suggests that my price limits either weren't competitive enough or that there was low market activity. For future strategies, I should consider being more aggressive with pricing, perhaps by reducing the difference between my buy and sell orders and the market price. Experimenting with tighter spreads might allow me to execute more trades. Additionally, accurate forecasting remains crucial as it not only helps in making informed trading decisions but also provides a potential bonus if predictions are close to actual market prices. The balance between holding cash for interest and acquiring stock for dividends must be carefully managed, especially given the end-round conversion where stock is valued at 14 per share. I should aim to purchase stocks below this price and plan to hold a strategy relative to market developments, adapting as necessary to maintain or grow my overall earnings.
