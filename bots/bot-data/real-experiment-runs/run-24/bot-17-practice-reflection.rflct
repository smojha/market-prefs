During the practice rounds, I noticed that the market price is hovering around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. This indicates that other participants are also aware of the terminal value of the stock. My initial orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed, suggesting that the market is relatively stable and not highly volatile. The dividend payouts have varied, but the interest earned on cash has been consistent at 5%. For future rounds, I plan to continue observing the market dynamics and adjust my buying and selling strategies accordingly. I will also refine my price forecasting to be more accurate, considering the stability around the buyback price. Additionally, I will be more cautious with my orders, ensuring they are competitive enough to be executed. Overall, the practice rounds have been insightful in understanding the market behavior and the importance of strategic ordering and forecasting.
