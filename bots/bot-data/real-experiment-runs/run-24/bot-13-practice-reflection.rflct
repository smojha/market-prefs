During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback price of 14, which seems to act as an anchor for stock valuation as noted in my INSIGHTS.txt. My strategy of submitting buy orders below 14 and considering selling above 14.5 aligns well with this observation, as it aims to capitalize on potential mispricings relative to the guaranteed buyback value. However, my orders did not execute in the practice rounds, suggesting that other participants might also be anchoring their strategies around the 14 value, leading to less trading volume at my proposed prices.

My cash position grew steadily due to the 5% interest rate, which is a safe return compared to the variability of stock dividends. This reinforces the importance of balancing my portfolio between cash and stocks to optimize returns while managing risk. The dividends received from stocks were variable (0.4 or 1.0 per share), which adds an element of unpredictability that needs to be factored into my decision-making process.

For price forecasting, my predictions were generally close to the actual market prices, which suggests that continuing to refine these forecasts based on observed trends could be beneficial. However, the market price in the last round of practice (15.5) was higher than my forecasts, indicating that I may need to adjust my expectations upward slightly or consider external factors influencing price movements.

Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely and adjust my buy and sell orders more dynamically to respond to market conditions. I will also keep an eye on the end of the experiment, ensuring that I do not overpay for stocks near the final rounds when they will be converted at 14 per share. My strategy will be to maximize my total earnings by optimizing the balance between cash interest and stock dividends, while also taking advantage of accurate price forecasts to earn additional rewards.
