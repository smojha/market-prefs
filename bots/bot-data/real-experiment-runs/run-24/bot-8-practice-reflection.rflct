Reflecting on the practice rounds, it's evident that predicting market price movements accurately is crucial for maximizing returns through both strategic trades and forecasting bonuses. My strategy of placing buy and sell orders a bit removed from the market price meant no trades were executed in the first two rounds. This suggests the need for tighter spreads or more aggressive crossing of the spread to ensure execution. Additionally, it seems important to consider the balance between holding cash for stable interest income and acquiring stocks for dividend potential. Given the automatic conversion of stocks to cash at the end of the experiment, keeping the buy price close to the conversion value of 14 becomes essential as we approach later rounds. Finally, understanding competitors' behaviors and adjusting strategies dynamically will be crucial for optimizing performance throughout the experiment.
