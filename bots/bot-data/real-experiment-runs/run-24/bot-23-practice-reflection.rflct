Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons and observations I want to share with my future self:

1. Value Analysis:
- The fundamental value of each share includes both dividends (avg 0.7 per period) and the 14.0 buyback value
- At market price of 15.0, shares seem slightly overvalued near the start given the limited remaining dividend periods

2. Trading Strategy:
- Market volume has been low (0-2 shares per round), suggesting limited liquidity
- My limit orders at 13.0 (buy) and 15.0-16.0 (sell) haven't executed, indicating I may need to be more aggressive with pricing
- Important to maintain cash reserves for opportunistic buying

3. Risk Management:
- Critical to reduce share holdings as we approach round 30 since shares will be worth only 14 regardless of market price
- Interest earnings (5% per period) provide steady returns - don't undervalue cash position

4. Price Forecasting:
- My forecasts (14-17 range) have been relatively stable, reflecting fundamental value considerations
- Need to factor in both technical trends and fundamental value when forecasting

5. Action Items:
- Consider tightening bid-ask spread on orders to increase execution probability
- Monitor price-to-fundamental value ratio to guide trading decisions
- Maintain disciplined approach to avoid overpaying as we get closer to final buyback
