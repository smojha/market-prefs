        "plan": "In the final round, I will not submit any orders to buy or sell, as the market price is above the buyback value, and holding onto my shares will maximize my earnings upon conversion. My price forecasts will reflect the expected stabilization of the market price near the buyback value of 14.",
        "insight": "The stabilization of the market price at 18 in the final rounds suggests a collective strategy among participants to secure shares at prices still profitable upon conversion. My decision to hold onto shares rather than sell them at the current market price is driven by the guaranteed conversion value of 14, which is lower than the current market price. The importance of timing and accurate forecasting has been less critical in the final rounds as the market dynamics have become more predictable, focusing on the buyback value.",
