During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14.0, suggesting a potential equilibrium point that could be strategically important as we approach the end of the experiment. My initial strategy involved testing the market's response to different buy and sell orders within the range of 11.0 to 17.0, but no trades were executed, indicating a need for more aggressive order placement to cross the spread effectively. The balance between holding cash and stock was crucial, given the 5% interest rate on cash and the variable dividends from stock, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share. This balance needs careful management to maximize returns, as evidenced by the portfolio growth from the interest and dividends earned in each round. My price forecasting was aimed at identifying trends, but the actual market prices did not deviate significantly from the buyback price, suggesting that my forecasts need to be more closely aligned with this equilibrium. As we move into the main experiment, I plan to adjust my strategies to be more aggressive in order placement, refine my price forecasting based on observed trends, and keep the buyback price of 14 in sharp focus, especially in the later rounds, to optimize my position. The insights gained from these practice rounds will be invaluable in adapting my approach to the dynamic market conditions expected in the upcoming trading periods.
