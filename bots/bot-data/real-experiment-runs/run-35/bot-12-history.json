        "insight": "The market has stabilized at a price of 20, which is higher than the buyback value. This continues to suggest a cautious approach to selling shares at this price to secure profits. As the experiment progresses, the risk of holding stocks increases due to the conversion rate at the end. It is essential to balance the potential for further gains and dividend income against the risk of a lower conversion value. Adapting to market dynamics by adjusting order submissions and price forecasts remains key to maximizing earnings.",
