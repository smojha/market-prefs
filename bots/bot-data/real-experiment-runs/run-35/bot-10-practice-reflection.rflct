During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback value of 14, which aligns with the insight that this could be an equilibrium point. My strategy of placing buy orders slightly below the market price at 13 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market may not have enough liquidity or that other participants are also cautious about trading at prices significantly different from the current market price. This experience reinforces the need to closely monitor market trends and possibly adjust my order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution.

The dividends earned from the stocks were consistent at 1.6 per round, which, combined with the interest earned on cash, provided a steady increase in my cash holdings. This indicates that holding stocks can be beneficial, especially if purchased at or below the buyback price of 14, as it offers the potential for higher returns compared to just holding cash.

My price forecasts were based on the assumption that the market price would remain stable or slightly increase over time, which was somewhat accurate given the market prices in the practice rounds. However, refining these forecasts to be within 2.5 units of the actual price will require more attention to historical data and possibly incorporating more dynamic elements into my forecasting model.

Moving forward, I plan to adjust my strategy to be more aggressive in buying stocks when the price is at or below 14, while also being prepared to sell if the price rises significantly above this level as the experiment nears its end. Additionally, I will continue to refine my forecasting techniques to maximize additional cash rewards from accurate predictions. The practice rounds have been instrumental in testing and adjusting my strategies, and I am confident that these adjustments will help maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
