During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly around the buyback price of 14.00 per share. This stability suggests that the market is efficiently pricing the stock based on its known end value, which aligns with my insights noted in the INSIGHTS.txt file. The lack of executed trades in both rounds indicates low liquidity and a general reluctance among participants to cross the spread, which I need to consider for future trading strategies.

My strategy of submitting buy orders at 14.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any trades, reinforcing the need to possibly adjust my order prices to increase the likelihood of execution, as planned in PLANS.txt. The dividends earned from holding stocks and the interest from cash are significant, supporting a balanced approach between holding stocks and maintaining a cash reserve.

For the upcoming rounds, I will continue to refine my price forecasts based on the observed market stability and the impact of dividends and interest. Given the current market price of 14.5 per share and the buyback price of 14.00, I will consider buying more stocks if the price dips to or below 14.0 to align with the end-of-experiment value, while maintaining sufficient cash to capitalize on potential opportunities and earn interest.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and participant behavior, which I will use to adapt and optimize my trading and forecasting strategies in the main experiment.
