During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, which aligns with my insights about a potential equilibrium point. My strategy to buy shares at a price lower than the market price (13.0) was not executed, suggesting that the market did not dip to that level, or the volume was insufficient to meet my order. This indicates a need to adjust my buying strategy to be more aligned with current market conditions, possibly by setting my buy limit orders closer to the market price or being willing to cross the spread if necessary to execute trades.

My cash balance increased due to interest and dividends, reinforcing the importance of balancing cash holdings with stock ownership. The 5% interest on cash provides a steady, albeit lower, return compared to the potential dividends from stocks. Given the current market price of 14.5 and the buyback price of 14, holding onto my shares seems beneficial as long as the market price does not significantly exceed the buyback value, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.

My forecasts were somewhat optimistic, predicting a gradual increase in market price. If these trends hold, I might consider selling some shares at a higher price before the final round if the market price rises significantly above the buyback price. However, if the market price remains stable or decreases, holding the shares until the end would be more advantageous due to the guaranteed conversion value.

Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my strategies dynamically. I will consider setting my buy orders at a slightly higher price to increase the likelihood of execution and evaluate selling opportunities if the market price moves favorably. Additionally, I will keep refining my price forecasts to improve my chances of earning the forecasting rewards, which could add to my final earnings.
