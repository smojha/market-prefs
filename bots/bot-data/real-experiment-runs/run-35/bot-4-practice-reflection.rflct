During the practice rounds, I observed a stable market price hovering around the stock's buyback value of 14.0, with slight fluctuations. This stability suggests that the market values the stock close to its intrinsic value, which aligns with the buyback price at the end of the experiment. The lack of executed trades at my set limit orders (13.0 for buying and 15.0 for selling) indicates a tight market spread, suggesting that significant price movements are unlikely without substantial changes in market dynamics or participant behavior.

The high dividend payout of 1.6 per share in both rounds underscores the benefit of holding stocks, especially when compared to the steady but lower return from cash interest. My strategy of maintaining a balance between holding stocks for dividends and keeping cash for interest has been effective so far, as evidenced by my increasing cash balance from interest and dividends.

Looking forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. Given that the stock's value at the end will be fixed at 14.0, it's crucial to avoid buying stocks at prices significantly higher than this, particularly in the later rounds. I will adjust my trading strategy based on market liquidity and any shifts in price trends, potentially becoming more conservative as we near the final rounds to ensure I do not overpay for stocks relative to their buyback value.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions have been close to actual market prices, which is encouraging. I will continue to refine these forecasts, aiming to stay within the 2.5-unit margin to earn the forecasting rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have been valuable for understanding market dynamics and refining my trading and forecasting strategies. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by balancing risk and return, and adapting to any changes in market conditions.
