During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, hovering around the buyback value of 14.0. This stability suggests that the market might be gravitating towards this value, which is crucial for setting future trading strategies. My submitted buy and sell orders at 13.0 and 15.0, respectively, did not execute, indicating that the market may be less volatile than anticipated. This lack of volatility could mean that more aggressive limit orders might be necessary to participate in trades.

The dividends and interest earned each round have been consistent, reinforcing the importance of balancing my portfolio between stocks and cash. Stocks provide dividends, which can be beneficial if the market price stays above or near the buyback value. However, holding cash also yields a 5% interest each period, which is significant and should not be overlooked.

My price forecasting during the practice rounds was somewhat off, with forecasts slightly underestimating the actual market price. This indicates a need for refining my forecasting model to better predict market movements, which will be crucial for maximizing earnings through accurate forecasts.

Looking forward to the main experiment, I plan to adjust my strategies based on these observations. I will aim to buy stocks if the price drops below 13.0, capitalizing on potential dividends and price increases, while being mindful of the end-game buyback price. Conversely, I will consider selling stocks if the price rises above 15.0 to lock in profits, especially as we near the end of the experiment. Maintaining a cash reserve will be essential for exploiting buying opportunities and earning interest, but I must be ready to deploy more cash if market conditions are favorable.

Overall, the practice rounds have been invaluable in shaping my approach to the main experiment. I will continue to monitor market trends closely, refine my price forecasting, and adapt my trading strategies to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
