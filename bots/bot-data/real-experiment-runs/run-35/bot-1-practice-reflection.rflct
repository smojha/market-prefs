During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14, which aligns with the insights I've noted about the market's correlation with this value. My strategy of holding onto my 4 shares was beneficial, as I received dividends that ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share, which added to my cash reserves. The cash also earned a 5% interest each round, contributing to my total cash increase from 100 to 123.21 over the three rounds. My attempts to buy more shares at a limit price of 13 were unsuccessful, indicating that the market did not drop to that level during these rounds, and this supports my plan to continue monitoring for such opportunities.

Regarding my price forecasts, I aimed to stay within the 2.5 unit range of the actual market prices to earn the additional rewards. My forecasts were generally conservative, predicting slight increases over time, which reflects my expectation of gradual price appreciation toward the end of the experiment due to the impending buyback. I will continue to refine these forecasts based on observed trends and market dynamics.

For future rounds, I will maintain my strategy of holding onto my shares unless a significant opportunity arises to buy more at a price below the buyback value, considering the potential for high dividends and the end-of-experiment conversion rate. I will also keep a close eye on my cash reserves, ensuring they are sufficient to capitalize on buying opportunities while earning interest.

Overall, the practice rounds reinforced the importance of understanding market dynamics and adapting strategies accordingly. I will continue to use the insights and plans documented in PLANS.txt and INSIGHTS.txt to guide my decisions, aiming to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
