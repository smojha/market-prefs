During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered closely around the buyback price of 14.0, which is crucial for planning my strategy in the main experiment. My initial strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my pricing may need to be adjusted to be more competitive. The dividends received were high at 1.6 per share, which supports a strategy of holding stocks for dividend income, though this must be balanced against the steady 5% interest on cash. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, suggesting that a conservative approach to forecasting might be beneficial. Moving forward, I will adjust my buy and sell orders to be closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution. I will also continue to weigh the benefits of holding stocks for dividends against the safety and steady growth of cash holdings. The practice rounds have been instrumental in refining my understanding of market dynamics and in testing different strategies, which I will further refine in the upcoming main experiment rounds.
