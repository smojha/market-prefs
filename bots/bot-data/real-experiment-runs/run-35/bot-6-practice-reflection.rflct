During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 14.0 and 14.5 per share. My orders to buy at 13.0 and sell at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my pricing strategy may need adjustment to align more closely with market dynamics. The dividends earned from holding stock were consistent, contributing significantly to my cash position, alongside the 5% interest earned on cash each period.

Moving forward, I plan to refine my strategy by slightly adjusting my buy and sell orders to be more in line with the current market price, possibly buying at 14.0 and selling at 14.5 to increase the likelihood of trade execution. I will continue to maintain a balanced portfolio, ensuring I have enough cash to take advantage of potential buying opportunities while also holding onto stocks to benefit from dividends.

My forecasting approach needs further refinement, as my predictions were slightly off from the actual market prices. I will focus on improving my short-term and medium-term forecasts by closely monitoring market trends and adjusting my predictions accordingly.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of aligning my trading strategy with current market conditions to maximize returns. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, adapting my strategies as needed to optimize my earnings.
