During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained close to the buyback price of 14.0, which suggests a strong influence of the end-of-experiment conversion rate on market behavior. My strategy of testing the market with different buy and sell orders helped me understand that liquidity might be low, as none of my orders were executed. This indicates that my order prices may need to be more competitive to engage in trades effectively.

I noticed that maintaining a balance between cash and stock is crucial, as cash earns a 5% interest each period, while stocks provide dividends and potential capital gains. My current cash-to-stock ratio seems appropriate, but I will continue to adjust it based on market trends and my performance in earning dividends and interest.

In terms of price forecasting, my predictions were slightly off, which suggests I need to refine my analysis of market trends. I will focus more on historical price movements and adjust my forecasts more dynamically.

As we approach the end of the practice rounds, I will be more cautious about the price at which I buy stocks, ensuring that I do not overpay relative to the buyback price. This strategy will help maximize my earnings at the end of the experiment.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in understanding market dynamics and the importance of adapting strategies based on other traders' behaviors and market conditions. I will use these insights to refine my approach in the main experiment, focusing on optimizing my total earnings from stocks, cash, and accurate price forecasts.
