During the practice rounds, I focused on maintaining a balance between cash and stock to leverage both dividend payments and interest earnings. My strategy was to buy stocks at or below the buyback price of 14 to ensure a profit at the end of the experiment. This approach was based on the observation that the market price hovered around the buyback price, suggesting a conservative strategy might be beneficial. I did not execute any trades during the practice rounds as the market prices were slightly above my set buy limit, which indicates a need to possibly adjust my buy limits to be more competitive in the main rounds.

The 5% interest on cash played a significant role in my decision-making, as it provided a steady, risk-free return compared to the fluctuating dividends from stocks. This reinforced the importance of not overcommitting to stocks at high prices and maintaining sufficient cash reserves.

My price forecasting was based on a gradual increase in market price over time, which did not align perfectly with the actual market movements. This suggests that I need to refine my forecasting model to better predict market trends, possibly by incorporating more historical data and considering market dynamics more closely.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring market trends closely and adjust my strategies accordingly. I will maintain or increase my stock holdings if the price is at or below the buyback price to secure profit at the end. I will consider selling stocks only if the price significantly exceeds the buyback price for short-term gains. Balancing the portfolio between cash and stocks will remain crucial to leverage both dividend payments and interest earnings. I will use the insights gained from the practice rounds to refine my strategies and forecasts for the main experiment.
