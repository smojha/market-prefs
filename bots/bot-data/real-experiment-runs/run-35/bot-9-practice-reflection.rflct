During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback value of 14, suggesting a stable equilibrium. My conservative strategy of setting buy orders below 14 and sell orders above 14 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market did not fluctuate enough to trigger my limit orders. This suggests a need for potentially more aggressive strategies or a willingness to cross the spread to engage in trades. The steady dividends and interest accumulation have been beneficial, reinforcing the value of maintaining a balanced portfolio that leverages both cash and stock assets. For future rounds, I should consider adjusting my limit orders to be more competitive, possibly by incrementally increasing my buy price and decreasing my sell price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. Additionally, my forecasting strategy needs refinement as my predictions were slightly off, which could impact potential earnings from accurate forecasts. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends closely, possibly experimenting with a mix of conservative and more aggressive trading tactics to optimize my portfolio's performance and adapt to any emerging market dynamics.
