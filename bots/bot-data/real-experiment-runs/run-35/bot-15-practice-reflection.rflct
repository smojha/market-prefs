During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, indicating a stable equilibrium influenced by the known end-of-experiment conversion rate. My strategy of attempting to buy stock below 14 to capitalize on dividends and the final conversion was not successful, as my buy orders at 13 were not filled. This suggests that the market may not dip below the buyback price frequently, and I should consider adjusting my buy limit orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. Additionally, my attempt to sell at 15 in the second round was also unfilled, indicating that other participants may also be holding onto their shares in anticipation of the buyback value or higher dividends. This highlights the need for a more aggressive selling strategy if the market price significantly exceeds 14 as the experiment nears its end to lock in profits. The interest earned on cash provided a steady return, which could serve as a safer strategy if stock prices remain stable. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my strategies accordingly, balancing my cash and stock holdings to maximize returns from both dividends and interest. I will also refine my price forecasting to improve my chances of earning the forecasting rewards, using the market data and trends observed during the practice rounds as a guide.
