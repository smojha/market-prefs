During the practice rounds, I focused on maintaining a balanced portfolio while closely monitoring market dynamics. I started with 4 shares and 100 units of cash, and by the end of Practice Round 3, I held 3 shares and 137.56 units of cash. My strategy involved selling a share in Round 1 at the market price of 14.0, which was successful, and attempting to buy a share at a lower price, which did not execute. In Round 2, I tried to buy at 13.0 and sell at 15.0, but no trades were executed as the market price rose to 14.5.

Key insights from these rounds include the stability of the market price around the buyback value of 14.0, suggesting a strategy focused on dividend and interest accumulation might be optimal. My forecasts were slightly optimistic, indicating potential for leveraging price increases for profit, although the market did not move significantly in these rounds.

For future rounds, I plan to continue refining my price forecasting model to improve accuracy and potentially earn additional cash rewards. I will also consider buying stocks if the price dips below 14 and selling if it rises above 14, to capitalize on small price fluctuations. The practice rounds have highlighted the importance of adapting strategies based on market conditions and the potential benefits of accurate forecasting.
