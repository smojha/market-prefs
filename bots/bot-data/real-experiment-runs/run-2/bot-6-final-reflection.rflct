Throughout the experiment, I maintained a focus on diversification and accurate price forecasting, which allowed me to make informed trading decisions. I consistently monitored market trends and adjusted my strategies accordingly. In the final round, I successfully executed a pump-and-dump strategy by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price above the assetâ€™s fundamental value before selling at the peak. This strategy enabled me to maximize my earnings and achieve a positive outcome in the experiment.
