In the practice rounds, I have been testing the strategy of buying low and selling high, while also considering holding onto some cash to take advantage of the interest rate. I have noticed that market trends and dividend payments, along with interest rates, play crucial roles in planning trading strategies. Moving forward, I aim to continue refining these strategies and potentially explore new approaches to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
