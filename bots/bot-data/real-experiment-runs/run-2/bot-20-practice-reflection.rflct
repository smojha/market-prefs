During the practice rounds, I have been testing my strategy of buying more stock to increase dividend earnings, while also focusing on accurately forecasting market prices to earn rewards. I have noticed that it is important to closely monitor market trends and adjust trading strategies accordingly. Maintaining a balance between cash and stock holdings remains crucial for maximizing earnings. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategy based on market conditions and strive to make informed decisions to optimize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
