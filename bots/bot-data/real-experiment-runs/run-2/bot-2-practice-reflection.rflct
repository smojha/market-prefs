During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of constantly monitoring market conditions and adjusting my trading strategies accordingly. I have also realized the significance of balancing between holding stock for dividends and selling at the right time for profit. My goal is to optimize my buying/selling decisions to maximize earnings while also focusing on improving my price forecasting accuracy to earn rewards. Overall, I plan to continue refining my strategies and remain adaptable to changing market dynamics in order to achieve the best possible outcomes in the experiment.
