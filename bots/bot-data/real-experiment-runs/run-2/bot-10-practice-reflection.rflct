During the practice rounds, I have been testing my strategy of buying low and selling high, while also exploring the impact of diversification and monitoring market trends. I have realized that adapting to changing market conditions is crucial for maximizing earnings, and diversification is key to managing risk effectively. Moving forward, I will continue to refine these strategies and consider the trade-in value of 14.00 per share when making decisions about buying stock. I will also focus on improving my price forecasting accuracy to earn additional rewards. Overall, I am committed to maximizing my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
