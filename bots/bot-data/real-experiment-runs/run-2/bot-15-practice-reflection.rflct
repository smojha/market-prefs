During the practice rounds, I have observed the importance of adjusting buying and selling strategies based on market conditions. I have successfully bought shares at lower prices and sold them at higher prices, maximizing my earnings. I will continue to monitor the market closely and adapt my strategies as needed to ensure I am making informed decisions. Flexibility and quick reactions to market changes will be key in maximizing my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
