During the practice rounds, I have been focusing on refining my portfolio balance strategies and exploring different trading techniques. I have realized the importance of staying flexible in response to market changes and optimizing my portfolio composition. Additionally, I have been working on improving my price forecasting accuracy to enhance my decision-making process. Moving forward, I will continue to analyze market trends, make well-informed decisions based on historical data and current conditions, and adapt my strategies as needed to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
