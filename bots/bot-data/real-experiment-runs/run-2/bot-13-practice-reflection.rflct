During the practice rounds, I have been focusing on monitoring market trends, diversifying my investment portfolio, and experimenting with different trading approaches. I have realized the importance of adapting my strategies based on market data and adjusting my plans accordingly. Moving forward, I will continue to prioritize maximizing my total earnings by strategically buying and selling stocks, earning dividends, and optimizing my cash earnings through interest. I will also pay closer attention to my price forecasts to potentially earn additional rewards. Overall, I aim to improve my trading decisions to achieve higher returns in the upcoming trading periods.
