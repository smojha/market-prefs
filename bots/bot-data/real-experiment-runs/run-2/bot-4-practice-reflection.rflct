During the practice rounds, I have observed the importance of monitoring market dynamics closely and adapting my trading strategy accordingly. I have also realized the need to improve my price forecasting accuracy to maximize earnings. In the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue testing the strategy of buying low and selling high while also focusing on fine-tuning my price forecasting skills. Overall, my goal is to optimize my total earnings by making informed decisions based on market conditions and forecasting accuracy.
