Based on my current portfolio information and past trading history, I believe I should continue testing the strategy of buying low dividend stocks and selling high dividend stocks. I have had success in executing trades based on this strategy, and I want to further refine my limit price-setting to improve the profitability of my buying and selling decisions. Additionally, accurate price forecasting has been identified as a key factor in maximizing earnings, so I will continue to focus on making precise predictions to earn additional rewards. Overall, I am satisfied with my progress in the practice rounds and will carry forward these strategies into the main experiment for optimal results.
