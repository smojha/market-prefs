After reviewing my past strategies and market data, I have realized the importance of balancing my portfolio between stock holdings and cash. I need to be more strategic in my buying and selling decisions to maximize my earnings. Moving forward, I plan to be more cautious with my buying orders and aim to sell stock at higher prices to earn more dividends. I also need to be more accurate with my price forecasts to potentially earn additional cash rewards. Overall, I need to continuously adapt my strategy based on market conditions to ensure I am maximizing my earnings in each trading period.
