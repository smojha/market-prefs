Throughout the experiment, I focused on actively trading stocks and adjusting my strategies based on market conditions. I aimed to maximize my earnings by carefully timing my buys and sells, anticipating price movements, and taking advantage of dividend payments and interest earnings. However, in hindsight, I realize that I should have been more cautious with my trading decisions and not solely focus on maximizing short-term gains. Moving forward, I will strive to strike a balance between aggressive trading and risk management to achieve more consistent returns.
