After reviewing my past performance and the current market data, I plan to continue with my strategy of monitoring market trends and adjusting my strategies accordingly. I will prioritize diversifying my portfolio by considering both short-term gains through dividends and long-term gains through interest. Additionally, I will focus on accurate price forecasting to earn rewards. I will also be more cautious when considering buying STOCK at higher prices, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where the trade-in value is fixed at 14. Overall, I aim to maximize my total earnings by making strategic decisions based on market conditions and my portfolio goals.
