Throughout the experiment, I focused on maximizing earnings through strategic buying and selling of stocks, dividend earnings, and optimizing cash earnings through interest. I also paid attention to price forecasts to potentially earn additional rewards. Looking back, I have learned the importance of adaptability and flexibility in trading strategies. I experimented with different approaches to optimize my earnings potential, and I believe this helped me perform well in the experiment. Moving forward, I will continue to emphasize flexibility in my trading strategies and be open to trying out new approaches to further improve my performance.
