During the practice rounds, I have focused on implementing a strategy of selling stock when the market price is high and buying stock when the price is low. This strategy has allowed me to maximize dividend earnings and adapt to market trends. I also made forecasts for future market prices to potentially earn additional cash rewards. Moving forward, I will continue testing and refining this strategy while closely monitoring market dynamics and adjusting my portfolio accordingly to maximize total earnings at the end of the experiment.
