During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of monitoring market trends closely and adjusting my trading strategies accordingly. I have also realized the significance of making accurate price forecasts to earn additional rewards. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on balancing buying and selling stock effectively to maximize profits. I will also pay close attention to the impact of both dividend earnings and interest on my total earnings. Overall, I aim to refine my trading strategies and decision-making process to achieve better outcomes in the upcoming trading periods.
