In the practice rounds, I have been testing different trading strategies with a focus on maximizing dividends and adjusting to market conditions. I have realized the importance of staying adaptable and flexible in my approach to trading, as well as closely monitoring the market to make informed decisions. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies based on market dynamics and aim to make decisions that maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
