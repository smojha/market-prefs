During the practice rounds, I have observed that my strategy of buying additional stock when the market price is low and selling when the price is high has been effective in generating cash earnings. I have also been successful in accurately forecasting prices, earning rewards for my predictions. Moving forward, I plan to continue utilizing these strategies while also considering the trade-in value of stock at 14.00 per share. Additionally, I will aim to stay updated on market trends and make well-informed decisions to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
