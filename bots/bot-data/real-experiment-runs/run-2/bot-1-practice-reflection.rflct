Based on my experience in the practice rounds so far, I have learned that testing a combination of aggressive and conservative trading strategies can be beneficial. I have also realized the importance of staying flexible and adapting to changing market dynamics. Moving forward, I plan to continue exploring different trading approaches to see which one yields better results. Additionally, I need to carefully consider whether it is worth buying more STOCK at the current market price of 16.5 per share, considering the trade-in value of 14.00 per share after the last round. Overall, I believe that a combination of strategic planning, adaptability, and careful decision-making will be crucial in maximizing my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
