During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 15-16. My limit buy order in round 1 was too low and wasn't filled. In round 2, I successfully bought one share at 16. My sell orders have not been filled, suggesting that the market isn't willing to buy at prices much higher than the current market price.  It appears that buying low and selling high is a challenging strategy given the current market dynamics. I will continue experimenting with placing buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price in hopes of filling orders when the market price moves favorably. I need to be mindful of the final buyback price of 14 and avoid buying shares significantly above that value, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.  My current forecast strategy seems reasonable, but I will monitor its accuracy and adjust it as needed.
