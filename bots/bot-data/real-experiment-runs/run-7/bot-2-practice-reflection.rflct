Across the three practice rounds, the market price has remained above the final buyback price of 14.  It started at 15 in round 1, then moved to 16 in rounds 2 and 3.  My limit orders in round 2 (buy at 13, sell at 17) were not filled, indicating a tighter trading range than I anticipated.  It seems participants are optimistic about the stock's value, even though the expected value of dividends plus interest on cash might suggest a lower price.  I need to refine my understanding of how other participants are valuing the stock to predict future price movements.  For the main experiment, I will initially focus on observing market behavior and submit limit orders at slightly varying price points around 14 to explore market depth and participant sentiment.  As for forecasting, my initial predictions tended towards the conservative side. While I should remain cautious about over-inflating prices, I need to incorporate the upward trend observed in these rounds for my future predictions.
