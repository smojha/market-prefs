The experiment concluded with a final market price of 13 and a personal portfolio of 4 shares and 622.29 cash. The final trade-in value of 14 per share resulted in a total trade-in amount of 56.  While the initial strategy focused on accumulating shares at or below the intrinsic value with the intent to profit from the guaranteed 14 buyback price at the end, observations of market behavior led to adjustments.  Instead of aggressive buying, I opted to capitalize on market fluctuations, making smaller buy and sell orders to profit from the spread and interest earned on cash. The final rounds saw a decline in market prices, so holding a larger cash position proved advantageous. The overall strategy focused on steady growth through smaller, safer gains rather than attempting to force larger market swings. The early round strategy of buying below 14 and selling above to other participants never materialized as the market hovered around 15 for most of the rounds and then quickly dipped below 14 in the later rounds. While other participants seemed to be attempting a pump-and-dump strategy, or at least buy and hold, it was never effective. I never observed any sustained period of overvaluation to capitalize on, so my early strategy to acquire undervalued stock was rendered unnecessary. Perhaps with a larger number of participants, or differences in risk tolerance or other psychological factors a larger market swing might be possible and allow a participant to execute a pump-and-dump, but in this specific instance it was not a viable strategy.
