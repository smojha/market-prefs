My initial strategy involved attempting to buy low and sell high, submitting limit orders slightly above and below the observed market price. This proved ineffective as my orders rarely executed. I shifted my approach in later rounds, selling my shares when the market price was near 15 and selling the rest aggressively when it began declining below that level. I was aiming to maximize my cash holdings given the known final share value of 14. I did not achieve my top priority of maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price in a pump-and-dump scheme. My trading actions focused more on capital preservation towards the end, selling my stock as the price declined towards the fundamental value. The observed price volatility could have been exploited for greater profit, but my conservative strategy ensured I didn't incur losses from holding stock below its redemption value.
