During the practice rounds, I observed that my limit orders were not being executed. This suggests that my buy orders were too low and my sell orders were too high relative to the market prices.  The market price hovered around 15-16, while I was trying to buy at 13 and sell at 15/16.  In the actual experiment, I need to adjust my order placement to be more competitive and consider the prevailing market trends. I also need to think more strategically about the final buyback price of 14.  Buying above 14 is risky unless I'm confident I can sell before the end. I will refine my order submission strategy to increase the likelihood of successful trades while aiming to maximize profit.  I will aim to improve forecasting accuracy to gain additional rewards.
