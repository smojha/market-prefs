My overall strategy was to maximize profits by capitalizing on the fixed buyback price of 14 and the 5% interest rate on cash. Initially, I attempted to gauge market sentiment and participate in price discovery during the practice rounds and the beginning of the main experiment by submitting both buy and sell orders around the prevailing market price. 

As the experiment progressed and the market stabilized around 15, I began selling my shares when the price was at or above 15 to take advantage of the favorable price difference compared to the buyback price. This strategy allowed me to accumulate cash, which then generated interest income at a rate of 5% per round.

Around round 19, observing a dip in the market price to 12, I deviated from my initial strategy and purchased 4 additional shares, anticipating a potential price rebound. However, the market continued to decline, reaching 11 in subsequent rounds. I adjusted by selling off the excess shares to minimize potential losses from the buyback price. By round 24, I had successfully liquidated all my stock holdings and focused solely on accumulating cash through interest.

Despite the downward trend in the market towards the end of the experiment, my focus on generating interest income and capitalizing on early favorable trading opportunities proved profitable.  The final rounds, while less active in terms of trading, allowed for steady cash growth through interest accumulation. A key learning was the importance of balancing active trading with passive interest generation to maximize returns in this specific market environment with a known final buyback price.
