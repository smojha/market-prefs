My initial strategy involved alternating buy and sell orders slightly above and below the observed market price to test market responsiveness and potentially profit from fluctuations.  However, the market demonstrated a consistent trend toward the fundamental value of 14 as the experiment progressed.  This observation led to a shift in my strategy, focusing on aggressive buying at or below 14 in the later rounds, which resulted in increased profits from the buyback at round 30.  Maximizing volume and forcing a "pump-and-dump" proved unsuccessful. The most profitable approach was capitalizing on the predictable market behavior near the end of the experiment.
