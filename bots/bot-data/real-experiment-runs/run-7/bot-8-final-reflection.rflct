My overall strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on market fluctuations and the guaranteed buyback price of 14. Initially, I observed market prices fluctuating between 15-16, then dropping to 14-15, and eventually settling around 13. I focused on acquiring shares during these dips. However, my limit orders were often unexecuted in later rounds as other agents became more aggressive buyers, potentially indicating their increasing confidence in an upward trend. 

While my initial approach yielded some success in accumulating shares below the buyback price, the increasing competition made it difficult to execute larger trades. My attempts to 'pump and dump' were unsuccessful, as I was never able to substantially inflate the price and then capitalize on it. There were also missed opportunities to sell around round 15, where prices remained consistent for several rounds.

The late-round surge in buy orders suggests that some players might have overestimated the stock's value or engaged in speculative buying, creating a temporary bubble.  My conservative approach of selling off shares when the price dipped below 14 limited my potential profits but also mitigated losses. In retrospect, smaller, more frequent orders with price increments closer to the market price, and perhaps a more aggressive buying strategy in the mid-game to further capitalize on periods of price stability around 15, could have been more advantageous.  In future experiments, exploring more complex order strategies, such as submitting multiple limit orders at varying price levels, or considering the impact of my own trades on market dynamics, might be beneficial. Also, more effectively predicting and reacting to the buying behavior of other agents would likely increase profitability.
