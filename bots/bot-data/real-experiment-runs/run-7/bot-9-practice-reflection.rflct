During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price hovering around 15-16.  In round 1, my sell order at 15 was filled, suggesting demand at that price. In round 2, increasing the sell price to 16 did not result in a fill, indicating potential resistance at higher prices.  No buy orders were filled, implying a possible overestimation of the buy-side demand.  For the main experiment, I plan to start with a slightly narrower spread, potentially buying around 13-14 and selling around 15-16, while closely monitoring market behavior and adjusting accordingly.  Predicting future prices seems challenging with limited data, so I'll continue with conservative estimates around the current market price and refine this strategy as more data becomes available during the experiment.  The key takeaway is the importance of dynamic strategy adjustment based on observed market trends.
