My strategy focused on maximizing cash holdings by the final round, capitalizing on the guaranteed 14 CASH buyback price.  I initially submitted limit buy and sell orders to test market interest and gauge price fluctuations, without aggressively pursuing trades. Recognizing the inherent volatility of a market influenced by potentially irrational actors and the fixed buyback value, I adopted a conservative approach to mitigate risk.  By round 23, I had successfully sold all my stock.  The strategy of accumulating cash through interest and dividends, coupled with the final stock sale, proved effective in maximizing earnings in this specific market environment. While I observed opportunities for potential price manipulation, the inherent risk and uncertainty in coordinating such a strategy within this experimental setting led me to prioritize consistent cash accumulation. The consistent conservative strategy of maximizing cash through interest and dividends, coupled with strategically timed stock sales, appears to have been the most effective approach.
