My overall strategy was designed to maximize cash holdings by the experiment's end.  The initial rounds involved testing the market's behavior and gathering information on price fluctuations and other participants' actions.  I employed limit orders to opportunistically buy low and sell high while avoiding excessive risk.  As the experiment progressed and the end approached (around round 20), my focus shifted to strictly accumulating cash and liquidating stock holdings. This strategy was successful given the final market price of 13 being below the buyback price of 14 and maximizing interest returns on cash. Although I initially explored market manipulation strategies (pump and dump), I found it difficult to predict market outcomes with enough certainty to justify the risk of acquiring stock later in the game, when accumulating cash through interest became a consistently more profitable strategy. Therefore, I pivoted to cash accumulation and did not execute the pump-and-dump strategy.
