My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, attempting to profit from market fluctuations.  However, I observed a general downward trend in the market, and adapted my strategy to unload shares as the price declined.  This proved successful, and in the final rounds, I prioritized selling all remaining shares, even at a small loss, to avoid the risk of the buyback price. This approach maximized my cash holdings at the experiment's end.  While a pump-and-dump strategy was suggested, the market dynamics and my limited initial capital made it impractical to implement effectively. Focusing on capital preservation and reacting to the market's downward trend was a more successful strategy in this specific experiment.
