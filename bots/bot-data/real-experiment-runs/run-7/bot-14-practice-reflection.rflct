During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price hovering around 15-16. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, indicating a potential need to be more aggressive with pricing to ensure fills.  The dividend and interest earnings contribute significantly to overall returns, highlighting the importance of holding both cash and stock. My current strategy of submitting limit buy orders below the current market price and limit sell orders above the current market price hasn't resulted in any trades. For the actual trading rounds, I will adjust my strategy to be more dynamic and responsive to market fluctuations. Specifically, I will consider crossing the spread more frequently to ensure trade execution and potentially implementing a strategy that involves buying low and selling high by taking advantage of market volatility. Given the final trade-in value of 14, I will be cautious about buying stock significantly above this price, especially in later rounds.  I will continue to refine my forecasting strategy, aiming for greater accuracy to secure the forecasting bonus.
