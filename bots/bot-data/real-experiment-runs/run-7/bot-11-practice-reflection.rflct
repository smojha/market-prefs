During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly, reaching 16 in round 2. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a need for more aggressive pricing, especially considering the final buyback price of 14.  I successfully bought one share in round 3 for 16 which indicates the market might be overvaluing the stock.  I need to be cautious about buying above 14, especially in later rounds. My current stock holdings are slightly higher than what I started with and cash is down so my early trading performance isn't optimal.  For the actual trading rounds, I will focus on maximizing cash earnings through dividends and interest while exploiting price fluctuations around the 14 buyback price.  I'll aim to acquire shares when the price is significantly below 14 and sell when the price is above 14, while factoring in the dividend returns when making buy/sell decisions. I also plan to evaluate the overall market trend to adjust my limit order pricing. Holding more cash earlier on seems to have been a more successful strategy with the increasing interest. If I'm holding stock, the stock needs to outperform the guaranteed 5% cash interest to be worthwhile. In summary, my strategy going forward will be to buy low (below 14 ideally), sell high (above 14), and favor accumulating cash through dividends and interest.  Price forecasting is currently a low priority, unless I see clearer patterns emerge in future rounds.
