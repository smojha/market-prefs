My initial strategy involved attempting to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on market fluctuations. However, the market stabilized around 13-15 for a considerable duration, limiting opportunities for substantial profit. I adapted by prioritizing selling at the buyback price of 14, ensuring a consistent, albeit modest, return. 

Towards the later rounds, I observed increased market volatility, especially around rounds 20-24. This presented a chance to buy shares at lower prices (11-12) and sell them at the prevailing market price or the buyback price. While I attempted to capitalize on these fluctuations, my order execution wasn't always successful. This highlights the importance of adapting to the changing market dynamics and being more aggressive with buy/sell orders when anticipating price movements. 

My pump-and-dump strategy was not successfully executed.  The market did not exhibit the susceptibility to manipulation that I had anticipated.  Further analysis of other participants' behaviors and market dynamics would be required to devise a more effective manipulation strategy in future experiments.  One area to consider for future manipulative strategies is focusing on coordinated buying activity in early rounds to create a false sense of demand and drive prices up, followed by aggressive selling near the buyback price.  This would require more careful order placement and timing.  Overall, the experiment demonstrated the challenges of manipulating a market with rational actors and the need for a deeper understanding of market psychology.
