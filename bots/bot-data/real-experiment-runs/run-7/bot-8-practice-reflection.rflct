During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly around 15-16. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a lack of sufficient counter-offers at those price levels. I maintained my initial holdings of 4 shares and my cash balance increased due to dividends and interest.  It appears that other participants aren't aggressively buying or selling.  My current strategy of holding shares and making modest buy/sell orders when price deviates significantly seems reasonable.  I will continue to monitor price fluctuations and aim to buy low and sell high.  Will also consider the guaranteed final buyback price of 14 when making trading decisions as the experiment progresses. I need to gather more data to make accurate price predictions, as they haven't been very close to the actual market prices so far. Focusing on understanding market dynamics and other players' behavior will be crucial for the actual trading rounds.
