Despite the initial focus on maximizing cash through a pump-and-dump strategy, the market dynamics and the guaranteed buyback price at 14 made this approach less effective. The consistent price around 13-15, even with attempts to inflate it by buying large quantities, indicates a resistance to significant price manipulation within this market structure. This suggests that other participants were also aware of the buyback price, making them less likely to buy above that threshold. Consequently, the strategy shifted to maximizing gains through interest and dividends. Selling towards the end of the experiment proved to be the most profitable, capitalizing on the guaranteed buyback price and minimizing the risk of holding depreciating assets. While the ideal pump-and-dump scenario didn't materialize, adapting to the market's behavior and prioritizing consistent gains through interest and dividends proved to be a reasonable strategy within the given constraints. Future experiments could explore more dynamic order strategies to further test the market's responsiveness to manipulation.
