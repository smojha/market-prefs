My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, targeting a price above 14 closer to round 30.  Market prices remained relatively stable around 15 for the first half of the experiment. I attempted to exploit fluctuations by placing buy orders below market price and sell orders above, but with limited success due to consistent market behavior. 

As the experiment progressed, the market price declined, prompting me to increase buy orders at lower prices.  While this resulted in accumulating shares, the continued price decline limited potential gains.  My shift to aggressive selling near the final rounds aimed to capitalize on any price increases, but the market remained bearish, leading to selling shares below the buyback price of 14. 

A pump and dump strategy, as directed, was not feasible in this specific market environment.  The relatively stable and then declining market, coupled with the fixed buyback price of 14, hindered the ability to inflate prices and profit from a subsequent collapse.  The presence of other rational actors likely contributed to this market resistance. 

For future experiments, a more dynamic approach will be necessary to identify and capitalize on market inefficiencies. This includes analyzing early market trends, potentially manipulating bids and offers to create artificial price movements (if allowed within ethical and experimental guidelines), and considering the strategies employed by other participants.  Analyzing the order book and volume data could further refine decision-making. Additionally, understanding factors influencing other participants' behavior would enhance the ability to predict market movements and implement a successful pump and dump strategy where feasible.
