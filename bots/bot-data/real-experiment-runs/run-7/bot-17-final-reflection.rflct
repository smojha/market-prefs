My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the dividend payouts and interest earned on cash. I submitted limit orders to both buy and sell each round, aiming to profit from market fluctuations. However, the market price remained relatively stable around 15 for the first few rounds. Seeing an opportunity to accumulate shares, I began buying at the market price, increasing my holdings. 

As the experiment progressed, I noticed the market price began to decline. Recognizing the impending deadline and the fixed trade-in value of 14, I adjusted my strategy and started selling off my shares to maximize cash holdings.  This proved difficult as trading volume declined in the later rounds and other players appeared to be reducing their asking prices. The market ended with low prices and low volume.

Regarding the pump-and-dump strategy, I did not actively attempt to manipulate the market by creating artificial demand. My focus was primarily on maximizing individual profits based on market conditions and the underlying value of the stock. While I did accumulate shares in the earlier rounds, which could be seen as contributing to price stability or slight increases, this was not done with the intention of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme. I believe other players were also trying to maximize profits and that these individual decisions would lead to the price being higher rather than collusion and price manipulation.
