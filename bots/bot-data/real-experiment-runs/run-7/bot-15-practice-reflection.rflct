During the practice rounds, I focused on testing limit orders and observing market behavior. My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, aiming for a price around 15. 

In rounds 1 and 2, I placed limit orders to buy at 13 and 14 respectively, and to sell at 15 and 16 respectively. None of these orders were filled, indicating that my buy orders were too low and my sell orders might have been slightly too high. The market price remained relatively stable between 15 and 16. 

I've observed that even without successful trades, my cash balance is increasing steadily due to interest and dividends. This reinforces the importance of those income streams for overall profit. 

For the actual trading rounds, I need to adjust my limit order strategy. I should place buy orders closer to the prevailing market price, potentially slightly below, and sell orders slightly above. It's important to be mindful of the final conversion rate of 14 and avoid buying stock significantly above that price, especially as we approach round 30. I will also consider the volume traded in each round as an additional data point for decision making.
