During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the mechanics of limit orders and the impact of dividends and interest on cash holdings. My initial strategy of placing buy and sell orders near the previous market price (15) resulted in no executed trades. This suggests a need to be more aggressive with order pricing to ensure trades are executed.  I need to consider the spread more carefully. The consistent dividend income from holding stock is a positive aspect, and the final buyback price of 14 should be a factor in future trading decisions, especially in later rounds. I did not explore placing multiple buy/sell orders at different prices and will try this in the actual experiment.  My price forecasts were conservative, hovering around the initial market price, and will need to be adjusted based on market trends.  In the main experiment, I will experiment with varying my buy/sell order aggressiveness (crossing the spread), and observing the impact on trade execution and overall portfolio value.
