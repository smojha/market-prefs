During the practice rounds, I focused on testing limit orders around the initial market price of 15.  In round 1, I successfully sold 1 share at 15 and attempted to buy 1 share at 13, but this order wasn't filled. In round 2, neither my buy order at 14 nor my sell order at 16 were filled, suggesting less market depth at these price points and a potential upward trend. Round 3 resulted in another unfilled buy order and an unexpected sale of 1 stock, leaving me with 2 shares and cash increased to 156.4. Key takeaways are that the market can be illiquid and predictable strategies may not always execute.  Moving forward, I need to consider the buyback price of 14 and adjust my buying strategy to avoid overpaying. I also need to adapt to the market's price and volume fluctuations and potentially widen the bid-ask spread on my orders to increase the likelihood of fills.
