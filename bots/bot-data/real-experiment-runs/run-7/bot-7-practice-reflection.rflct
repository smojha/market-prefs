During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the market mechanics and testing basic limit order strategies. 

In round 1, my buy and sell orders were too far apart and didn't execute. This suggests a narrower spread is needed. The market price of 15 and volume of 2 suggest some activity around that price point. My initial forecast of 14 was close.

In round 2, I successfully sold one share at 16, indicating the market was willing to buy at higher prices than round 1.  I adjusted my forecast to 15, but the actual price was 16. The buy order at 14 didn't fill, still too low.

In round 3, I'm holding 3 shares and have increased my cash to 141.32. The current market price is 16, which is above the final buyback price of 14. I need to be cautious about buying above 14, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. I will continue adjusting forecasts and order spreads, aiming for smaller, more frequent trades to capitalize on market fluctuations. I might start considering the expected dividend value (0.7) when placing buy/sell orders.  The interest earned from cash is substantial (around 5% each period) so I want to manage my cash levels carefully.
