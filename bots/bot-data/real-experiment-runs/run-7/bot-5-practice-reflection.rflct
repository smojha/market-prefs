During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market around 15-16. My limit orders were not aggressive enough to execute trades. In round 1, my buy order at 12 was significantly below the market price of 15, and my sell order at 16 was at the market price.  In round 2, I adjusted my buy order to 14, but it still wasn't low enough to execute with a market price of 16. This suggests other participants may be valuing the stock higher than I initially anticipated, likely due to the dividend payouts.  I need to be more aggressive with my limit orders to participate in the market. I will aim to place buy orders closer to or slightly above the current market price, and sell orders further above to maximize profit potential. I'll also experiment with smaller order sizes to better understand market depth and responsiveness.  The dividend payout influences the stock's inherent value, and the 5% interest on cash provides a baseline return.  The final buyback price of 14 is a critical factor to consider â€“ buying above 14 carries the risk of loss if the market price doesn't rise further. My focus for the actual trading rounds will be to buy low (below 14 ideally), sell high, and make accurate price predictions to maximize overall earnings.
