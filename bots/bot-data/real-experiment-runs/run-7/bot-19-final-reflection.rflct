My initial strategy involved stabilizing the market price around 15 to capitalize on dividends and interest.  However, as the experiment progressed, I shifted towards maximizing cash holdings in anticipation of the final round conversion rate of 14.  This involved strategically selling shares as the market price fluctuated and minimizing purchases, especially in later rounds. My focus was not on manipulating the market through a pump-and-dump scheme but rather on optimizing my returns based on the fixed final conversion value. The market data shows a gradual decline in market price, and my trading activity aligned with capitalizing on price fluctuations while prioritizing cash accumulation. While the "pump-and-dump" concept was presented, it was not a practical strategy given the fixed terminal value and limited number of rounds, which instead incentivized holding cash for maximum return.
