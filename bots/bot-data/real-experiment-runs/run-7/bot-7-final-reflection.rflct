My initial strategy focused on incremental gains through limit orders, aiming to buy low and sell high around a perceived equilibrium price.  Forecasting was a consistent element, though its impact on overall earnings was limited. As the experiment progressed, I observed and adapted to market fluctuations.  In the mid-game, selling at the market price and occasionally buying below market price presented opportunities.  However, the final rounds required a shift in focus towards the fixed buyback price of 14.  The strategy of selling above 14 and buying below 14 became crucial for maximizing profit, but market volatility even in the later rounds necessitated continuous assessment and adjustment.  Ultimately, while the "pump and dump" concept was considered, the constrained environment and other participants' strategies made it unfeasible. The most consistent gains came from exploiting the guaranteed buyback price in the final rounds.
