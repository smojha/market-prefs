Across the three practice rounds, my limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15-16 haven't executed, indicating other participants are employing similar strategies centered around the buyback price of 14.  The market price has fluctuated slightly, rising from 15 to 16.  Zero volume in practice rounds 2 and 3 supports the theory of conservative play.  The upward price movement despite no trades suggests some latent buy pressure, perhaps due to expected dividends.  It is crucial to consider dividends and interest when valuing the stock. Given the consistent dividend payouts and 5% interest, holding stock, especially if acquired below 14, is potentially more profitable than holding cash.  For the main experiment, I'll explore more aggressive buying strategies at lower price points (12-13) in earlier rounds to acquire stock and benefit from accumulated dividends and interest.  I will also consider selling at a range above 15-17 in the final rounds as I suspect there may be some higher bids closer to the end. Additionally, I will need to factor in the guaranteed buyback price of 14 when placing buy and sell orders, especially as the experiment nears its end.  I will also consider implementing more sophisticated strategies, potentially involving moving averages or trend analysis, during the actual experiment.
