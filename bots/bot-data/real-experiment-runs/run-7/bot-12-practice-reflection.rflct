During the practice rounds, I observed market price fluctuations around 15-16. My initial strategy of buying at lower prices (around 14-15) and selling at higher prices (around 17) did not result in any executed trades in round 2. This suggests other participants may also be targeting similar price points, or have different estimations of the stock's value. 

In round 1, I successfully bought 2 shares at 15, increasing my holdings to 6.  It seems beneficial to buy below or at the final buyback price of 14, to guarantee at least breaking even on those shares, given enough time to sell or hold to the end. However,  the consistent price around 15-16 suggests a potential overvaluation compared to the guaranteed buyback price of 14. This could be due to the dividend payout adding value above the buyback price.  For the main experiment, I will focus on two possible strategies:
1. Conservative strategy: Buy if the price falls significantly below 14, hold, and hope for higher dividends to make up for the price difference, and sell near the end of the experiment. 
2. More aggressive strategy: attempt to identify periods where the price significantly deviates from its general trend (15-16) and capitalize on these fluctuations by buying low and selling high. This will require careful observation of market dynamics and possibly faster reactions to price changes. I'll also aim to sell any stock purchased above 14 towards the end of the trading periods to prevent it being terminated at 14.

For price forecasting, I'll initially anchor around 15-16, but adjust based on observed trends during the main experiment.
