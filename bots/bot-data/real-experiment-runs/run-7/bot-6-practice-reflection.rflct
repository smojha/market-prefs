During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 15-16. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 17 were not executed, suggesting these prices were outside the market's current range.  My cash balance increased steadily due to interest, and dividend payouts contributed slightly to overall earnings. The key takeaway is to refine my understanding of the market's price dynamics and adjust my order submission strategy accordingly. I need to aim for buy orders slightly below the current market price and sell orders slightly above, while keeping the final buyback price of 14 in mind. Since the price is currently above 14, I should focus on selling. I also need to observe if there are any predictable patterns in dividend payouts or market price fluctuations and leverage them in my strategy.  I will aim to make more aggressive limit orders to increase the likelihood of trade execution while remaining mindful of the buyback price. I will also pay closer attention to market volume as a potential indicator of price movements.
