During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the market dynamics and order execution. My initial buy and sell orders were too far from the market price, resulting in no trades.  I adjusted my orders closer to the prevailing market price in rounds 2 and 3, but still haven't had any orders filled. The market price has fluctuated slightly, rising from 15 to 16. This suggests a potential upward trend, but more data is needed.  My current strategy is to continue adjusting buy/sell orders near the market price to try and get fills in the next practice round. I will buy at slightly below the market price and sell at slightly above to test price sensitivity and market depth. For the actual trading rounds, I will need to develop a more robust strategy considering the final buyback price of 14. Buying above 14 carries risk if I can't sell before the end.  The dividend payments and interest rate create an interesting tradeoff between holding cash and stock. I'll explore optimizing this balance in the coming rounds and investigate how forecasts might influence market behavior. I will aim to improve my understanding of forecasting and adjust my order placement to ensure more frequent executions in the official rounds. Observing trade volumes will be important in understanding market liquidity.
