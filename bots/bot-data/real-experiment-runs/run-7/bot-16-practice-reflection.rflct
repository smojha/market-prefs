During the practice rounds, I observed low market volume, suggesting hesitant trading or limited participation.  My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, indicating a wide spread between buy and sell orders. This reinforces the need to be mindful of the spread when submitting orders in the future. 

The market price has remained relatively stable around 15-16.  While the dividend payout is decent, the slow price movement combined with the final buyback price of 14 suggests a cautious approach to buying.  It may be beneficial to prioritize accumulating cash through interest and dividends while looking for opportunities to buy low and sell high, but being aware that the market is thin. 

Forecasting remains challenging due to limited data. I will continue to refine my forecasting strategy as more price data becomes available.  The potential reward for accurate forecasts provides an additional incentive to improve prediction accuracy.
