Across all three practice rounds, none of my limit orders were executed. This suggests my buy/sell margins are too narrow relative to the current market dynamics.  Prices seem to be trending upwards slightly.  The market may be illiquid and resistant to large price swings or other participants may have similar order strategies. For the experimental rounds, I will widen the buy/sell spread to increase the chance of order execution. I will also slightly increase my target buy price while keeping the target sell price slightly above the observed market price. For forecasting, my initial prediction of 14 seems consistently too low, so I will increase this for the experimental rounds.
