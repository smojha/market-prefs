Across the three practice rounds, I've observed relatively low trading volume and limited price volatility.  My limit orders haven't executed, suggesting a persistent spread between buy and sell offers.  The market price has hovered around 15-16.  This could indicate either a general consensus on value or a lack of strong incentives for trading. Going into the experimental rounds, I need to consider the following:

1. **Price Discovery:** The true market value remains unclear due to low volume. I should explore placing orders closer to the prevailing market price to test the waters and get a better sense of actual demand and supply. 
2. **Spread Management:**  I need to anticipate the bid-ask spread and place orders strategically to maximize my chances of execution. This might involve being more aggressive with my buy and sell limits, accepting slightly less favorable prices to ensure trades go through.
3. **Long-Term Value:** The final stock buyback price of 14 is crucial. Purchasing above this threshold introduces risk, especially in later rounds. I need a strategy to gradually reduce my stock holdings as we approach round 30 to avoid being left with overvalued shares. 
4. **Dividend vs. Interest:** The dividend payouts have fluctuated, making it hard to consistently rely on stock income. The 5% interest on cash provides a stable return, which should be factored into my trading decisions. 
5. **Opponent Behavior:** I need to account for the potential irrationality of other players and adapt my strategy accordingly.  This might involve looking for opportunities to exploit predictable patterns or biases in their trading.

For the initial experimental rounds, I'll aim to gain more market information through more frequent, smaller trades and observe how other players react.  I'll also start incorporating the round number into my decision-making, becoming more conservative with stock purchases as we approach the end of the experiment.
