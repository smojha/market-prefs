The experiment concluded with a final market price of 13 and a stock buyback price of 14. My final portfolio consisted of 7 shares and 552.04 cash.  While the initial rounds saw the price stabilize around 15, the market trended downwards in later rounds. My strategy shifted from accumulating stock at what I perceived to be undervalued prices (below 15) to aggressively selling my holdings as the final rounds approached to maximize cash before the forced conversion at 14.  The pump-and-dump strategy was difficult to execute given the relatively stable market dynamics and the transparent, simultaneous nature of trading with other participants.  Achieving significant price inflation above the fundamental buyback value proved challenging as the market showed a tendency to correct towards the buyback price as the experiment progressed.  Although I tried to buy strategically and then sell near 14, other players may also have attempted this or other arbitrage strategies.  Final payout is $15.39 including participation and bonuses.
