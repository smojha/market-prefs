My initial strategy involved accumulating shares at lower prices and holding them until the final rounds, anticipating a price increase.  However, the market dynamics didn't consistently favor this approach. I adapted by strategically selling shares when prices rose above my target, generating profit through these transactions. In the final rounds, I attempted to capitalize on the fixed buyback price by acquiring shares below 14 and selling into any upward price movement. Ultimately, my focus was on acquiring shares at lower prices to profit from selling at high prices. The market dynamics in this experiment, with its set buyback price and other participants with their own incentives, meant the classic 'pump-and-dump' strategy wasn't feasible.  It was more important to capitalize on the predictable element of the buyback, and on the less predictable speculative activity of other participants.
