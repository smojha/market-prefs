During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price has remained above the buyback price of 14.  My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 16 were not filled, suggesting a relatively tight market spread. It seems like other participants might also be anchoring to the initial price of 15 or have optimistic expectations about future prices.  I will maintain my strategy of buying low and selling high, but I need to be mindful of the approaching end of the experiment.  As we get closer to round 30, I need to avoid being left holding stock that I cannot sell at the buyback price.  I might need to be more aggressive with my sell orders in later rounds to ensure I can liquidate my position.  My price forecasts of 14 consistently underestimated the actual price.  I will adjust my forecasts upwards for the actual trading rounds, perhaps targeting a range between 14 and 17.
