My initial strategy involved alternating buy and sell orders slightly above and below the market price to test market responsiveness and potentially profit from fluctuations. I aimed to acquire more shares at lower prices and sell them when the price increased, anticipating a general upward trend.  However, the market price remained relatively stable around 15, limiting my gains from this approach.

Around round 12, I noticed a dip in the market price and decided to buy more shares, anticipating an eventual price recovery. While the price did not immediately rebound as expected, I maintained my holdings, hoping for a later increase.  

In the later rounds, recognizing the impending end of the experiment and the fixed trade-in value of 14, I shifted my focus to maximizing cash holdings. I began selling my shares, even at slightly lower prices than before, to ensure I had sufficient cash at the end.  While my trading strategy didn't yield significant profits from price fluctuations, my final focus on maximizing cash ensured a reasonable payout at the experiment's conclusion. 

Considering the pump-and-dump strategy, I recognize its potential for maximizing profit in this scenario. However, without sufficient coordination with other players, artificially inflating the market price would have been difficult.  Further, given the limited number of rounds and the inherent risk of the strategy backfiring, I prioritized a more conservative approach to ensure a reasonable return.  In a real-world setting, a pump-and-dump strategy would be highly unethical and illegal, and I wouldn't consider implementing it.
