During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 14 and 16, which is significant given the buyback value of 14 at the end of the experiment. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 14 was not executed, suggesting that the market did not fall to that level, and I maintained my initial holding of 4 shares throughout the practice rounds. The dividends received were beneficial, with a total of 5.6 cash earned from dividends, which, combined with the interest on cash, increased my cash holdings from 100 to 123.33 by the end of the third practice round. This indicates that holding cash can provide a steady return, but the potential for higher returns from stock dividends and capital gains must be considered, especially as the market price moves above the buyback value.

My price forecasts were set with an incremental increase, anticipating a possible rise in market price over time. None of these forecasts were tested against actual outcomes during the practice rounds, so I will need to refine this approach based on real-time data during the main experiment.

Moving forward, I will continue to monitor the market closely. If the price stays at or below 14, I will consider purchasing more shares, particularly as we approach the end of the experiment. If the price rises significantly above 14, I may hold onto my shares or sell them if the market seems overvalued, aiming to buy back at a lower price. Balancing the risk of holding cash versus investing in stocks will be crucial, especially with the potential for price fluctuations and the final conversion rate of stocks to cash.

In summary, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of adapting strategies based on observed trends. I will use these insights to refine my approach in the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
