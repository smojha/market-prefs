Throughout the experiment, my primary goal was to execute a pump-and-dump strategy to manipulate the market price of the STOCK far above its fundamental value, then sell at the peak for maximum profit. I observed the market trends and adjusted my trading strategy accordingly. Initially, I focused on buying shares at lower prices to accumulate a significant position, which I successfully did by Round 16, owning 13 shares. As the market price increased, I strategically placed buy orders slightly below the market price to ensure I could acquire more shares without driving the price up prematurely. This approach was effective in increasing my share count without significantly influencing the market price.

Once the market price reached 23.0 in Round 17, I began to shift my strategy towards selling. I placed sell orders at prices higher than the current market to attempt to drive the price up further. However, the market did not respond as expected, and I was only able to sell one share at 23.0 in Round 18. Recognizing the market's resistance to further price increases, I adjusted my strategy to sell at the current market price, successfully selling two shares at 22.0 in Round 21.

As the market began to decline, I continued to sell off my shares, managing to sell four shares at 14.0 in Round 28 and the remaining six shares at 14.0 in Round 29. This allowed me to cash out before the final round, ending with zero shares and a cash balance of 519.96.

Reflecting on the experiment, I believe my strategy was partially successful. I managed to inflate the market price to some extent and sold at a profit. However, the market's reaction to my selling pressure was not as strong as anticipated, suggesting that other participants were not as easily influenced by my actions as I had hoped. In future iterations, I would consider more aggressive buying to create a stronger bubble and potentially collude with other participants to ensure a more significant price spike before selling.

Overall, my total earnings were $14.65, which included a participation fee, market bonus, and a small forecast bonus. While this amount is satisfactory, a more effective pump-and-dump strategy could have potentially yielded higher profits.
