During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 14 and 16, which is close to the buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment. This suggests that other participants are also considering the final buyback price in their trading decisions, leading to a relatively stable price range. My strategy of not submitting orders in the first round and attempting to buy at a lower price in the second round was not successful, as my limit order of 13 was not filled when the market price was 15. This indicates that the market might not dip below the buyback price often, and I need to be more aggressive in my buying strategy if I want to increase my stock holdings at a favorable price.

The dividends earned from holding stocks were beneficial, with a total of 5.6 cash earned over two rounds, in addition to the interest earned on cash. This reinforces the insight that holding stocks can be profitable, especially if the market price does not significantly exceed the buyback price. However, as the market price in the last practice round was 16, which is above the buyback price, it might be wise to consider selling some stocks if the price continues to rise above 14, to lock in profits before the end of the experiment.

My price forecasts were mostly accurate, with the exception of the 10-period forecast for round 12. This suggests that I need to refine my forecasting strategy, possibly by considering longer-term trends and volatility more carefully. The potential to earn additional cash through accurate forecasting is significant and should be a key part of my overall strategy.

Moving forward, I plan to adjust my trading strategy to be more proactive in buying stocks when the price is close to or below 14, while also being ready to sell if the price rises significantly above 14. I will continue to monitor market trends closely and refine my forecasting approach to maximize my earnings from both trading and forecasting.
