During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated around the buyback price of 14, with prices ranging from 14 to 16. My strategy of maintaining a position of 4 shares and accumulating cash through dividends and interest appears to be effective, as evidenced by the steady increase in my cash balance from 100 to 123.33 over the three rounds. The dividends provided a reliable income stream, with earnings of 1.6 and 4.0 in the first two rounds, respectively, while the interest on cash added a safe return component to my strategy.

My attempts to buy at 13 and sell at 15 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market was not willing to cross these thresholds during the practice rounds. This indicates that I may need to adjust my limit order prices to be more competitive in the actual experiment.

Regarding price forecasting, my predictions were set to gradually increase over time, which aligns with the observed trend of the market price moving from 14 to 16. However, I must remain vigilant and adapt my forecasts based on real-time market data to maximize my chances of earning the additional 5 units of cash for each accurate prediction.

As I approach the actual experiment, I will continue to monitor the market closely, especially around the buyback price of 14. If the price drops below 14, I will consider increasing my holdings at a favorable price. Conversely, if the price rises significantly above 14, I will look to capitalize on potential price increases by submitting sell orders. I will also continue to refine my price forecasting strategy based on observed market trends to optimize my earnings from accurate predictions.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into the market dynamics and the effectiveness of my current strategy. I will carry these lessons forward into the actual experiment, remaining adaptable and focused on maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
