In reflecting on the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price significantly above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I focused on buying shares to increase my holdings, which can be seen from my purchases in the early rounds, such as Round 4 and Round 5 where I aggressively bought stocks at increasing prices. This was done with the intention of driving up demand and, consequently, the market price.

As the experiment progressed, I noticed a clear trend of price increases, which I capitalized on by holding onto my shares longer, anticipating a peak. The market dynamics shifted around Round 20, with prices beginning to decline, signaling the potential peak and the beginning of the 'dump' phase of my strategy. In Round 29, I executed my plan by selling all my shares at the market price of 14.0, which aligned with the buyback price, ensuring I did not suffer any loss on the trade-in value.

My strategy of inflating the price worked to some extent, as evidenced by the price reaching 23.0 in Round 18, significantly higher than the final buyback price of 14.0. However, I could have potentially maximized my gains by selling earlier, around Round 18 to 21, when the price was at its peak.

In terms of market manipulation, I believe I was successful in contributing to a bubble, albeit not as extreme as intended. The market's reaction and the eventual price drop suggest that other participants were also attempting similar strategies, leading to a collective bubble and burst scenario.

For future experiments, to enhance the effectiveness of a pump-and-dump strategy, I would focus on more aggressive buying in the early stages to inflate the price quicker and sell at the first signs of a peak, rather than waiting for the price to align with the buyback value. Additionally, coordinating with other participants to manipulate the market more effectively could be considered, although this would require careful planning and communication.

Overall, while I achieved the goal of selling at the buyback price, the potential for higher profits was evident earlier in the experiment, highlighting the importance of timing in executing such a strategy.
