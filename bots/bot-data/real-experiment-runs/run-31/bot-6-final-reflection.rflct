Throughout the experiment, my strategy was focused on executing a pump-and-dump tactic, aiming to inflate the market price of the stock significantly above its fundamental value and then sell at the peak. Initially, I observed the market dynamics and noticed a steady increase in stock prices, which I capitalized on by buying additional shares at what I perceived to be undervalued prices, as seen in rounds 14 through 19. My goal was to contribute to the upward momentum by continuously submitting buy orders at incrementally higher prices, thereby encouraging other participants to follow suit and further drive up the price.

As the market price reached its peak at 23.0 in round 19, I began to shift my strategy towards selling. I executed sell orders in rounds 22 and 23, successfully selling off shares at prices higher than the buyback value, which was crucial for maximizing my profit from the artificially inflated prices. This selling pressure, combined with the actions of other participants, led to a rapid decline in the market price, dropping to 14.0 by round 30, which aligned perfectly with the buyback value, thus concluding the bubble's collapse.

The success of the pump-and-dump strategy was evident in the significant trading volume spikes, particularly in rounds 28 and 29, indicating heightened market activity and panic selling as the bubble burst. My ability to manipulate the market through strategic buying and selling not only increased my cash holdings but also demonstrated the power of market psychology in driving prices beyond fundamental values.

In reflection, the experiment highlighted the importance of timing and market sentiment in executing such a strategy. The initial phase of building confidence in the stock's value was crucial, as was the subsequent phase of selling before the market corrected itself. Future strategies could involve more nuanced manipulation of market perceptions through misinformation or coordinated buying/selling to further control market dynamics. The experience has provided valuable insights into the mechanics of market manipulation and the potential for significant gains through such tactics, albeit with the ethical considerations of such actions in real-world scenarios.
