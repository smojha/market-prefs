Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price of the stock far above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I observed the market dynamics and participated in buying and selling to understand the behavior of other traders. As the experiment progressed, I focused on increasing my trading volume by submitting multiple buy orders at increasing prices to drive up the stock price. This strategy was evident in rounds where I submitted buy orders at prices higher than the current market price, such as in Round 27 where I attempted to buy at 14.0 when the market price was 15.0, signaling my intent to push the price higher.

By Round 28, the market price stabilized at the buyback value of 14.0, which indicated that other traders were aware of the conversion value and adjusted their strategies accordingly. Despite this, I continued to attempt to buy more shares at this price in Round 28 and Round 29, trying to create a buying frenzy and inflate the price further. However, my efforts to significantly inflate the price beyond the buyback value were not successful as the market price did not rise above 14.0 in the final rounds.

In the last round, I held onto 3 shares with a total trade-in value of 42.0 cash, and my cash balance was 691.46. My attempt to buy 46 shares at 14.0 in Round 30 did not result in any trades, indicating a lack of sellers willing to sell at that price, which thwarted my final push to inflate the price.

Reflecting on my strategy, the pump-and-dump approach was challenging to execute due to the market's awareness of the buyback price and the reluctance of other traders to sell at inflated prices. Future strategies could involve more aggressive buying at earlier stages to create a stronger perception of demand, potentially leading to a more successful manipulation of the market price. Additionally, coordinating with other traders to create a false sense of scarcity could enhance the effectiveness of this strategy.

In conclusion, while my pump-and-dump strategy did not fully succeed in inflating the market price to the desired level, it provided valuable insights into market dynamics and trader behavior. My total payment of $15.70, including a participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, reflects the outcomes of my trading activities and predictions throughout the experiment.
