Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a successful pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price of the STOCK well above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I observed the market dynamics, particularly noting the trend towards the buyback price as the experiment progressed. This insight guided my strategy to manipulate the market by strategically buying and selling shares to create artificial demand and increase the stock's price.

In the early rounds, I held onto my shares, accumulating dividends and interest, while monitoring the market price. As the price began to rise, I started selling shares at higher prices (e.g., selling 2 shares at 19.0 in Round 6 and 1 share at 22.0 in Round 13), which helped inflate the market price further due to reduced supply. Simultaneously, I engaged in buying shares at strategic points (e.g., buying 1 share at 20.0 in Round 7 and 1 share at 23.0 in Round 18) to maintain the upward momentum and create a bubble.

As the market approached the final rounds, I noticed the price starting to converge towards the buyback price of 14.0, indicating that other participants were also adjusting their strategies. At this point, I ceased buying and focused on holding my remaining shares, anticipating the final conversion to cash at the buyback price. My last transactions were aimed at maximizing my cash position while ensuring I could still benefit from the dividends and the guaranteed buyback value.

The pump-and-dump strategy was partially successful, as evidenced by the peak market price reaching 23.0 in Round 17 and 18, significantly higher than the buyback price. However, the market dynamics and other participants' rational adjustments prevented the bubble from growing as large as intended. I managed to sell shares at inflated prices, but the volume of trades and the peak price could have been higher with more aggressive manipulation.

In terms of price forecasting, I attempted to predict market movements to align with my manipulation strategy, but my forecasts were not always accurate, resulting in a minimal forecast bonus. This indicates that while I could influence the market to some extent, external factors and other participants' actions played a significant role in price determination.

Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into market manipulation and the challenges of executing a pump-and-dump strategy in a controlled environment. Future strategies could involve more aggressive buying to inflate the price further and more precise timing of selling to maximize profits before the market corrects itself.
