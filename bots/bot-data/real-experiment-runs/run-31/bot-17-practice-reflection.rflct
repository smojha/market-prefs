During the practice rounds, I observed that holding onto my stocks was beneficial due to the dividends received, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share per round. This strategy aligns well with the final conversion rate of 14 cash per stock, as the market prices during the practice rounds were around this value, suggesting stability. My cash also grew due to the 5% interest rate, which compounded effectively over the rounds. I attempted to buy additional stocks in the first two rounds but did not execute any trades, indicating that my buy orders were not competitive enough against the market price. This suggests a need to adjust my bidding strategy to be more aggressive if I aim to increase my stock holdings when I believe the price is favorable. My forecasts for future rounds showed a slight increasing trend, which I will need to monitor and refine as the actual experiment progresses, especially considering the accuracy reward of 5 cash units per correct forecast. For the upcoming main experiment, I plan to continue holding my stocks unless the market price significantly deviates from the 14 cash conversion value, at which point I will consider buying or selling based on the trend. Additionally, I will need to be more strategic with my order submissions to ensure I can execute trades when desired, and refine my forecasting method to maximize the additional earnings from accurate predictions.
