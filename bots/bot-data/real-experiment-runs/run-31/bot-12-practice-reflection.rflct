During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock increased from 14.0 in Round 1 to 16.0 by Round 3, indicating a potential upward trend. This trend suggests that other traders may be anticipating a higher value than the buyback price of 14.0. My strategy of submitting small buy and sell orders to test market liquidity was partially successful, as evidenced by the executed sell order in Round 2 at the market price of 15.0. This move increased my cash position significantly, which now stands at 138.41, with 3 shares of stock valued at 48.0 at the current market price.

My forecasts for future rounds were generally conservative, aligning closely with the buyback price, which may have been too cautious given the observed price increase. Moving forward, I will adjust my forecasting approach to consider the possibility of continued price appreciation, while still being mindful of the guaranteed buyback value of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment.

Given that the current market price is above the buyback value, I need to carefully consider whether to buy more shares at this price. The potential for a higher selling price in future rounds must be weighed against the risk of holding shares that might only be worth 14.0 at the end. I will continue to use small orders to probe the market without committing too much of my cash reserves, maintaining flexibility to adapt to market changes.

Overall, the practice rounds have been useful in understanding market dynamics and refining my trading and forecasting strategies. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by balancing the potential gains from stock price increases with the security of the guaranteed buyback value and the growth of my cash through interest.
