In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price increased from 14.0 to 16.0, which suggests a growing demand for the stock. My initial strategy of submitting buy and sell orders at 14.0 and 15.0 respectively was not aggressive enough in the first round, as no trades were executed. However, adjusting my sell order to match the market price in the second round resulted in a successful sale, increasing my cash holdings significantly. This indicates that being more responsive to the current market price can lead to better trade execution.

The dividends earned from holding stocks (1.6 in Round 1 and 3.0 in Round 2) highlight the benefit of maintaining stock ownership for income, despite the potential for capital gains or losses. The interest earned on cash (5.0 in Round 1 and 6.08 in Round 2) also plays a crucial role in my overall earnings strategy, suggesting a need to balance between holding cash and stocks.

My price forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which could potentially earn me additional cash rewards if this trend continues in the main experiment. However, I need to refine these forecasts further to increase my chances of receiving the rewards.

Moving forward, I plan to increase the aggressiveness of my trading strategy by submitting orders closer to the current market price to test market liquidity and response. I will continue monitoring market trends, particularly focusing on how dividend payouts influence stock prices. I also intend to refine my price forecasts based on the outcomes of these more aggressive trades and any shifts in market dynamics, while maintaining a balance between cash and stock to leverage both interest earnings and dividend income.

Given that the stock's trade-in value at the end of the experiment is fixed at 14.0 per share, and considering the last round's market price of 16.0, I must be cautious about purchasing stocks at prices significantly higher than 14.0 as the experiment nears its end. This strategy will help maximize my total earnings at the conclusion of the 30 rounds, taking into account stock value at buyback, cash earnings, forecast winnings, and any potential lottery winnings.
