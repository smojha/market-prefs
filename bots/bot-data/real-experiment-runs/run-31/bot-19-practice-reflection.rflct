During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly above and below the final buyback price of 14, suggesting a market equilibrium around this value. My strategy of not trading during the practice rounds allowed me to gather valuable data on price movements and dividend impacts without risking my initial capital. The dividends received provided a significant boost to my cash reserves, especially when the high dividend was paid, which supports the insight that holding stock can be more lucrative than holding cash due to the potential for higher returns from dividends compared to the fixed 5% interest on cash.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to implement a strategy based on the observed patterns. I will aim to buy stocks when the market price dips below 14, capitalizing on the potential for dividend earnings and the guaranteed buyback value at the end of the experiment. Conversely, I will consider selling when the market price rises significantly above 14, particularly as we approach the final rounds, to secure profits above the buyback price. This approach should maximize my total earnings by balancing the benefits of dividend income with the potential for capital gains from stock price appreciation.

Regarding my forecasts, I need to refine my predictions to fall within the 2.5-unit range of the actual market price to secure the additional cash rewards. I will continue to analyze past market data and adjust my forecasting model accordingly.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided a solid foundation for understanding the market dynamics and optimizing my strategy for the main experiment. I am confident that by adhering to these insights and adapting as necessary, I can maximize my earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
