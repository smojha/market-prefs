During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback price of 14.0, starting at 14.0 and increasing to 16.0 by the end of the third round. My strategy involved attempting to buy additional shares at prices below the current market price, specifically at 13.0 and 14.0, but no trades were executed. This suggests that my buy orders were not competitive enough to be filled, indicating that other participants were either holding onto their shares or setting higher sell prices.

The dividends received varied between 1.6 and 4.0 per round, reflecting the random nature of the dividend payouts. This randomness necessitates a flexible trading strategy that can adapt to different dividend outcomes. The 5% interest on cash provided a steady, albeit lower, return compared to the potential gains from stock dividends, highlighting the importance of balancing cash reserves with stock investments.

My forecasts for future rounds were slightly off, which suggests a need for more accurate price prediction strategies. The increasing trend in market prices could indicate a bullish market sentiment among participants, possibly driven by the anticipation of the buyback price at the end of the experiment.

Moving forward, I need to adjust my buy order prices to be more competitive, possibly closer to the current market price, to increase the likelihood of trade execution. I should also consider selling shares if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price to lock in profits. Maintaining a cash reserve is crucial for capitalizing on potential price drops and for flexibility in trading. As the experiment progresses, I will continue to refine my strategies based on market trends, dividend outcomes, and the accuracy of my price forecasts.
