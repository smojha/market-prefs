During the practice rounds, I observed a gradual increase in the market price from 14.0 in Round 1 to 16.0 in Round 3, which suggests a bullish trend. This trend is supported by my successful purchase of an additional share in Round 2 at the market price of 15.0, indicating that the market was willing to sell at that price. The high dividend payout in Round 1 (1.6 per share) reinforced the potential profitability of holding stocks over cash, despite the 5% interest rate on cash. My strategy of attempting to buy at a lower price in Round 1 (13.0) did not execute, which aligns with my insight that the market might not be willing to sell below the current market price. This suggests that to execute trades, I may need to meet or slightly exceed the current market price.

My forecasts were generally accurate for the near term but became less precise as the forecast period lengthened. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting skills, particularly for longer-term predictions, to maximize the additional cash rewards. As I move into the main experiment, I plan to continue testing different buy and sell strategies, adjusting my stock holdings based on dividend payouts, and using my price forecasts to guide my trading decisions. I will aim to buy low and sell high, but given the observed market stability and slight bullishness, I will also consider holding onto stocks longer to benefit from potential high dividends and the final buyback value of 14.0 per share. My goal is to balance the risk and reward between holding cash and stocks, adapting my strategy as market dynamics evolve throughout the 30 rounds.
