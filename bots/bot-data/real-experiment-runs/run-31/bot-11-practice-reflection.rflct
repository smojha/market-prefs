During the practice rounds, I observed several key trends and made strategic decisions based on the market data and my portfolio's performance. Starting with 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock, I managed to increase my cash holdings to 109.02 by the end of Practice Round 3 while maintaining 5 shares of stock. This was achieved by buying an additional share in Round 1 at the market price of 14.0, which aligns with my strategy to buy stocks at or below the buyback price of 14 to ensure a profit at the end of the experiment.

My strategy of monitoring the market closely and adjusting my approach based on market trends seemed effective. The market prices increased from 14.0 in Round 1 to 16.0 by the end of Round 3, which indicates a rising trend. This supports my plan to consider selling stocks if prices significantly exceed the buyback price, especially as we approach the final rounds to capitalize on short-term gains.

The dividends received were beneficial, with earnings of 2.0 in Round 1 and 5.0 in Round 2, adding to my cash reserves. The 5% interest on cash also contributed positively to my cash balance, reinforcing the insight that holding cash is not detrimental and can be used strategically.

My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which could potentially earn me additional cash at the end of the experiment if continued accurately. However, I need to refine my forecasting method to better predict future market movements and improve my chances of winning the forecasting rewards.

For the upcoming rounds, I will continue to adhere to my strategy of buying at or below 14 and selling above this price, especially as we near the end of the experiment. I will also keep a close eye on market trends and adjust my forecasts accordingly. Maintaining a balance between cash and stock holdings will be crucial to take advantage of buying opportunities and mitigate risks.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the effectiveness of my strategies. I will carry these lessons forward into the main experiment, focusing on adaptability and strategic decision-making to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
