During the practice rounds, I observed a gradual increase in the market price from 14.0 in the first round to 16.0 by the third round. This trend suggests that there might be a growing demand for the stock as the rounds progress, possibly influenced by the anticipation of the end-game buyback price of 14.0 per share. My strategy of holding onto my initial 4 shares and not making any trades during these rounds allowed me to benefit from both the dividends and the interest on my cash, which increased my total cash from 100 to 123.33 by the third round. This approach aligns with my initial plans to maintain a conservative stance and monitor market trends closely.

The dividends earned varied between 1.6 and 4.0 per round, reflecting the random nature of the dividend payouts. The interest earned on cash, at 5% per round, provided a stable return, reinforcing the value of holding cash as part of a balanced portfolio. My stock value at the market price increased from 56.0 to 64.0 over the three rounds, which, despite being above the buyback price, still suggests potential for profit if sold at the right time.

My price forecasts were conservative, starting at 14 for the first round and incrementally increasing to 17 for the 11th round forecast. This approach seemed reasonable given the observed price trend, though it remains to be seen how accurate these forecasts will be as we move into the main experiment.

Moving forward, I need to continue monitoring the market closely, particularly as we approach the final rounds where the buyback price becomes more relevant. I should consider selling my shares if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price, especially if I believe the price might drop. However, the potential for high dividends might justify holding onto the stocks if the market remains stable or continues to rise. Balancing the portfolio between cash and stocks will remain crucial, using the dividends and interest to guide my decisions.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of a flexible strategy that can adapt to market changes while maintaining a focus on the end-game dynamics. I will use these insights to refine my approach in the upcoming experiment rounds, aiming to maximize my earnings at the end.
