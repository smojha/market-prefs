During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price has been increasing steadily from 14 in the first round to 16 in the third round. This suggests a potential upward trend in the stock's value, which could influence my strategy in the main experiment. My initial buy and sell orders at 13 and 15 in the first round, and then at 14 and 16 in the second round, did not execute, indicating that the market is not moving significantly in response to my limit orders at those prices. This suggests that I may need to adjust my limit prices to be more competitive if I want to participate in trades.

Regarding my forecasts, I have been predicting a gradual increase in price, which aligns with the observed market trend. However, I need to refine these forecasts to ensure they fall within the 2.5 unit range for rewards. The dividends and interest earned have been consistent, providing a steady increase in cash, which is beneficial for future trading.

For the main experiment, I plan to start with more aggressive limit orders to test the market's response and possibly influence the price movement. I will also continue to refine my price forecasts based on the trends observed during the practice rounds. It's crucial to remember that the final trade-in value of the stock is 14, which is lower than the current market price of 16. This means that buying stocks at the current market price might not be optimal unless I can sell them at a higher price before the end of the experiment. Therefore, I will need to balance the potential for capital gains against the risk of holding stocks at the end of the experiment.
