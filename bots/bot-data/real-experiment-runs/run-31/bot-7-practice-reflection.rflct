During the practice rounds, I observed several key trends and made strategic decisions based on the data provided. In the first round, I successfully purchased an additional share at the market price of 14.0, which was beneficial as it aligned with the buyback price at the end of the experiment. This move increased my stock holdings and positioned me well for dividend earnings. However, in the second round, despite attempting to buy at a lower price and sell at the current market price, no trades were executed, indicating a potential need to adjust my limit order strategies to better align with market liquidity and dynamics.

The market price increased from 14.0 in the first round to 15.0 in the second, and then to 16.0 in the third round, suggesting a bullish trend. This trend influenced my decision to hold onto my shares, especially considering the dividends and the potential for further price appreciation. My cash position also improved due to the 5% interest earned each period, which provided a steady income stream alongside the dividends from the stock.

My forecasting strategy needs refinement. While my forecasts for the first two rounds were accurate, they became less so as the rounds progressed. This indicates a need to incorporate more dynamic elements into my forecasting model, possibly by considering more recent market trends and volume data.

Looking forward to the main experiment, I plan to:
1. Continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my trading strategy accordingly, especially as we approach the final rounds where the buyback price becomes more critical.
2. Experiment with different limit order prices to find an optimal balance between executing trades and maximizing returns.
3. Use my cash reserves strategically, considering both the interest earnings and the potential for purchasing additional shares at favorable prices.
4. Refine my forecasting model to improve accuracy, which could significantly impact my total earnings through the forecasting rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of aligning trading strategies with both current market conditions and the end-game scenario.
