During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly between 14.0 and 15.0. My strategy of placing buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that other participants were also cautious and possibly waiting for more significant price movements or better opportunities. The stability around the buyback price of 14.0 indicates a general consensus on the stock's value, influenced by the guaranteed conversion rate at the end of the experiment.

I successfully earned dividends from holding stocks, with a notable increase in the second round (4.0 cash), which supports the strategy of maintaining or increasing stock holdings to benefit from dividend payouts. The interest earned on cash (5.0 and 5.33 in rounds 1 and 2, respectively) also provides a safe but less lucrative return compared to potential gains from stock trading.

My forecasts were generally optimistic, expecting gradual increases in stock price over time. This approach aligns with my strategy to potentially benefit from selling at higher prices in future rounds. However, the actual market price did not move significantly, suggesting a need for more conservative forecasts or a strategy that focuses on the stability around the buyback price.

For the upcoming rounds, I will consider the following adjustments:
1. **Adjust Order Prices**: Given the market's stability, I may need to adjust my buy and sell orders to be closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution.
2. **Increase Stock Holdings**: If the market price remains at or below 15.0, it might be beneficial to increase my stock holdings to maximize dividend earnings, especially since the buyback price is 14.0.
3. **Monitor Market Trends**: Continuously monitor market trends and liquidity to adapt strategies dynamically.
4. **Cash Management**: Maintain a sufficient cash reserve to capitalize on buying opportunities and earn interest, but also consider using more of it to buy stocks if the market price is favorable.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of balancing risk and reward, considering the buyback price as a benchmark, and adapting strategies based on market conditions and participant behavior.
