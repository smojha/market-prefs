During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating a stable market with little price movement. The dividends and interest have been steadily increasing my cash reserves, which aligns with the Hold Strategy I planned to continue. This approach seems beneficial as it allows for passive income accumulation without the risk of trading at unfavorable prices.

The Active Trading strategy was not effective during the practice rounds due to the lack of price movement. However, I will keep this strategy in mind for potential future volatility. As we approach round 30, the Endgame Strategy becomes more critical. Given the current market price of 15 per share and the buyback price of 14, it would not be advantageous to buy more shares at this price. Instead, I should aim to sell any additional shares I might acquire at or above 14 to maximize returns.

My price forecasts have been slightly off, suggesting a need for more accurate predictions to earn the forecast rewards. I will need to refine my forecasting method based on observed trends and potential future market shifts. Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of the Hold Strategy and the need to be cautious with Active Trading until more significant market movements are observed. I will continue to monitor the market closely and adjust my strategies as necessary to optimize my earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
