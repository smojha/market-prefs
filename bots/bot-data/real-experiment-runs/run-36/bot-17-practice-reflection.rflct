During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback value of 14, peaking at 15 in the last round. My strategy of attempting to buy at 13 and sell at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my limit orders were not competitive enough to be filled. This suggests that I need to adjust my pricing strategy to be more aligned with the market dynamics, possibly by narrowing the spread between my buy and sell orders to increase the likelihood of execution.

The dividends received from holding stocks were significant, ranging from 1.6 to 4.0 per round, which underscores the potential benefit of holding stocks despite the market price being above the buyback value. The interest earned on cash, while consistent at 5% per period, was less substantial compared to the potential dividends from stocks, suggesting a preference for holding stocks over cash when the market price is not excessively high.

My price forecasts were generally conservative, starting at 14 for the immediate round and incrementally increasing to 17 for round 11. Given the actual market prices observed, these forecasts were reasonably accurate, but I need to refine my forecasting model to better predict short-term price movements and potentially earn the forecasting rewards.

For the upcoming experimental rounds, I plan to adjust my strategies based on these insights. I will aim to submit more competitive limit orders, possibly buying at prices closer to the current market price and selling when the price is just above the buyback value to ensure trades are executed. I will also continue to leverage the potential dividend income by holding stocks, especially when the market price is not significantly above the buyback value. Lastly, I will refine my forecasting approach to enhance the accuracy of my predictions, aiming to capitalize on the forecasting rewards offered.
