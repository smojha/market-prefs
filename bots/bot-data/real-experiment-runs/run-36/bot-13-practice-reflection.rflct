During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly from 14.0 to 15.0, while my strategy was to attempt buying at or below the current market price. This approach did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my limit orders were not competitive enough to be filled. The stability of the stock price near the buyback value of 14.0 indicates that holding stocks could be beneficial, especially if the price remains stable or increases slightly, as it would allow me to benefit from dividends and potential capital gains. However, the 5% interest on cash is a compelling reason to consider holding more cash, particularly if the stock price does not rise significantly above the buyback price.

My price forecasting strategy needs refinement. My forecasts were based on an expected gradual increase in price, which did not materialize as anticipated. In the main experiment, I will need to more closely monitor market trends and adjust my forecasts more dynamically to improve the accuracy and earn the forecasting rewards.

For the upcoming main experiment, I plan to adopt a more flexible strategy. If the stock price is close to or below the buyback value, I will consider buying more stocks to capitalize on dividends and potential price increases. However, if the stock price significantly exceeds the buyback value, I will lean towards holding more cash to benefit from the interest earnings. This approach should allow me to maximize my earnings based on the observed market dynamics and the inherent value of holding both assets.
