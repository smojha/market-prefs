During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly, moving from 14.0 in Round 1 to 15.0 by the end of Round 2. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating low liquidity or a lack of sellers at those prices. The dividends received from holding stock were beneficial, with a total of 5.6 units of cash earned from dividends across the two rounds. Additionally, the 5% interest on cash provided a steady, albeit smaller, return, accumulating to 10.33 units over the same period.

My current portfolio at the start of Round 3 shows an increase in stock holdings to 5 shares, with a corresponding decrease in cash to 110.98 units. This shift was likely due to a strategic decision to invest more in stock, anticipating potential dividend gains and a favorable buyback price at the end of the experiment. The market price at the end of Round 2 was 15.0, which is higher than the guaranteed buyback price of 14.0 per share. This suggests a potential for profit if I can sell at or above this price before the final round.

For the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy based on these observations. I will continue to monitor the market closely, adjusting my buy and sell orders based on the current market price and liquidity. Given the buyback price of 14.0, I will be cautious about purchasing stocks at prices significantly above this value as we approach the end of the experiment, to avoid potential losses upon conversion. I will also maintain a balance between cash and stock to benefit from both dividend payments and interest earnings.

My forecasting strategy needs improvement, as my predictions were not within the 2.5-unit margin for rewards. I will focus on analyzing trends more accurately to improve my forecasts, which could add to my earnings at the end of the experiment.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in shaping my approach for the main experiment. I will use the insights gained to adapt my trading and forecasting strategies dynamically, aiming to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
