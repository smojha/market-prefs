The lack of execution on my previous buy orders at lower prices indicates that other participants value the stock near the current market price. As we approach the end of the experiment, the buyback price becomes increasingly important, necessitating a more cautious trading strategy to maximize earnings.

This approach not only mitigated the risk associated with holding stocks at the end of the experiment but also maximized my cash holdings, which have been steadily increasing due to the interest earned. The market's upward trend towards the end of the experiment confirmed the wisdom of this strategy, as it capitalized on the increasing stock prices. The final rounds have shown that participants are cautious, and the market price has stabilized, reinforcing my decision to focus on cash preservation as the experiment concludes.",
