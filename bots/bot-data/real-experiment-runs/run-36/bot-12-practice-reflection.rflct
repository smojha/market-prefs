During the practice rounds, I observed the market dynamics and tested several strategies. Starting with 100 units of cash and 4 stocks, I aimed to understand the balance between holding cash, which earns a 5% interest per period, and holding stocks, which provide dividends of either 0.4 or 1.0 cash per unit with equal probability. The fixed buyback price of 14 per stock at the end of the experiment served as a crucial benchmark for my trading decisions.

In the first practice round, the market price was 14.0, and I attempted to buy 1 stock at 13.0 but the trade did not execute. My cash increased to 106.6 due to interest and dividends. In the second round, the market price rose to 14.5, and I again tried to buy at 13.0 without success. My cash further increased to 115.93 due to a high dividend payout and interest. By the third round, the market price was 15.0, and I now own 3 stocks with 140.48 cash.

Key insights from these rounds include the importance of timing and pricing in executing trades. The market price hovered around the buyback value, suggesting a balanced market. My unsuccessful attempts to buy at lower prices indicate a need to either adjust my limit order prices closer to the market price or be willing to cross the spread to ensure trade execution.

For the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy as follows:
1. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continue to closely monitor market prices and adjust my buying and selling strategies accordingly. If the market price is significantly above 14, I will consider selling stocks to lock in profits before the final conversion.
2. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio between cash and stocks, taking into account the potential for high dividends versus the steady interest from cash.
3. **Price Forecasting**: Use the data from the practice rounds to refine my forecasting model, aiming to predict within the 2.5-unit margin to earn additional cash rewards.

Overall, the practice rounds were valuable for testing and adjusting my approach. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
