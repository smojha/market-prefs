During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly, starting at 14.0 and rising to 15.0 by the end of the third round. This suggests a potential upward trend, though it's too early to confirm. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market might be less liquid or that other participants are also cautious in their trading decisions. This experience reinforces the need to possibly adjust my limit order prices to be more competitive if I wish to execute trades.

The dividends received were significant, with a high dividend of 1.6 in the first round and 4.0 in the second, highlighting the potential benefits of holding stocks. However, the market price of 15.0 in the last round being higher than the buyback price of 14.0 poses a risk if I buy at current market rates without selling before the end of the experiment. This suggests a need to balance my portfolio between holding cash for the 5% interest and investing in stocks for potential dividend gains, while always being mindful of the buyback price.

My price forecasts were generally optimistic, predicting a gradual increase over time. This approach was based on the initial trend observed, but I need to refine my forecasting model to better predict market movements, especially as the experiment progresses and more data becomes available. The reward system for accurate forecasts adds another layer of strategy, where correctly predicting within a 2.5-unit range can significantly boost my earnings.

Moving forward, I plan to:
1. Adjust my limit order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of executing trades.
2. Continue to monitor the market closely to better understand liquidity and price elasticity.
3. Maintain a balance in my portfolio, considering both the dividends from stocks and the interest from cash, while being cautious about the final buyback value of the stocks.
4. Refine my forecasting strategy based on ongoing market trends to maximize the potential rewards from accurate predictions.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in shaping my initial strategies and providing a foundation upon which I can build and adapt throughout the main experiment.
