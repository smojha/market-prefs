During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, starting at 14.0 and slightly increasing to 15.0 by the end of the third round. This stability suggests a consensus among participants regarding the stock's value, closely aligned with the buyback price of 14.0. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below the market price and sell orders slightly above did not result in any executed trades, indicating a cautious market where participants are not willing to deviate significantly from the perceived fair value. This cautious approach is further evidenced by the low market volume observed in these rounds.

The dividends and interest earned provided a steady income, with dividends varying between 0.4 and 1.0 per share and interest at a fixed 5% per period. This income stream is crucial and should be considered when deciding whether to hold or trade stocks. My current cash position of 125.73 and four shares valued at 60.0 (at the last round's market price) provide a solid foundation for the main experiment.

For price forecasting, my predictions were based on slight increments over time, assuming a gradual increase in market price. However, the actual market price movements were more conservative than anticipated, suggesting a need for more nuanced forecasting based on real-time market dynamics rather than linear projections.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy by:
1. Continuing to monitor market trends closely and adjusting my forecasts accordingly.
2. Being more aggressive in my buy orders if the market price dips below the buyback price, to capitalize on potential undervaluations.
3. Considering selling shares if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback price, to lock in profits.
4. Maintaining a balance between cash and stock to leverage both dividend and interest income.
5. Reflecting on each round's outcomes to adapt my strategy dynamically.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in understanding market behavior and refining my approach to maximize earnings in the main experiment.
