My previous strategy of setting buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price has not resulted in many executed trades, suggesting the need for more aggressive limit prices to increase liquidity and trade execution. My forecasting accuracy has improved but still needs refinement to maximize potential rewards. The growth in cash reserves provides a strategic buffer, but I must balance this with the risk of stock price fluctuations and the impending buyback conversion.",
