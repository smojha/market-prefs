In the practice rounds, I observed that the stock price remained relatively stable around the buyback value of 14, which suggests that other participants are also aware of this value and are trading accordingly. My strategy of placing buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market did not move far enough from the buyback price to trigger these orders. The dividends received varied between rounds, with a high dividend in Round 2 causing a slight increase in the stock price to 14.5, and then to 15 in the last round. This suggests that dividends do have some impact on price, but it is not drastic enough to move the price significantly away from the buyback value. My cash balance increased due to interest and dividends, but the potential for higher returns from stock suggests a need to balance between holding cash and investing in stock. For future rounds, I should consider adjusting my buy and sell orders closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution, while still being mindful of the buyback price. My price forecasts were generally accurate, but I need to refine them to account for the small fluctuations caused by dividend announcements. Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of understanding market dynamics around the buyback price and the need for a flexible strategy that adapts to changing market conditions.
