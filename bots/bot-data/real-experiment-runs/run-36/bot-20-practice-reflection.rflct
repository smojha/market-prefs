During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, starting at 14.0 and increasing slightly to 15.0 by the end of the second round. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating a cautious market where other participants might also be aware of the stock's buyback value of 14.0 at the end of the experiment. This cautiousness aligns with my insights that participants are likely aware of the final buyback price and are trying to balance the potential for dividend earnings against the risk of holding stocks at a price above the buyback value.

My portfolio grew from the initial 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock to 125.73 units of cash and a stock value of 60.0, thanks to dividends and interest. The dividends earned were significant, with 1.6 in the first round and 4.0 in the second, reinforcing the insight that holding stock can be beneficial due to the expected dividend value of 0.7 per share per round, which exceeds the 5% interest on cash.

For the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely. If the market price remains close to or above 14, I might consider selling some shares to lock in profits and increase my cash holdings, benefiting from the interest. However, if the price drops significantly below 14, buying more shares could be advantageous, especially considering the potential for dividends and the final buyback price.

My price forecasting was somewhat conservative, with forecasts slightly increasing over time. Given the actual market price movement, I need to refine my forecasting approach, possibly by analyzing trends more closely and adjusting my predictions based on recent market behavior.

In summary, the practice rounds have been valuable in testing my strategies and gaining insights into market dynamics. I will continue to adapt my strategies, focusing on maximizing my total earnings by balancing the benefits of holding stock for dividends against the security of holding cash for interest.
