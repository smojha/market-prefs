The increased market volume suggests more aggressive trading as the experiment nears its end. My strategy of adjusting sell thresholds and leveraging cash for interest while holding some stocks for dividends is still effective, but I must remain vigilant as market dynamics could shift rapidly. The buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment underscores the need to sell stocks at a higher market price to maximize earnings. Accurate forecasting remains crucial for additional rewards.",
