During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14.0, fluctuating slightly between 14.0 and 15.0. Despite submitting buy and sell orders, no trades were executed, indicating that my limit prices were not aligned with the market's willingness to trade. This suggests a need to adjust my limit order prices closer to the market consensus to facilitate trades.

The dividends from the stock provided a significant boost to my cash reserves, with earnings of 1.6 and 4.0 in the first and second rounds, respectively. Additionally, the 5% interest on cash added a steady, albeit smaller, increment to my cash balance. This balance between the potential returns from stock dividends and the guaranteed interest from cash is crucial for optimizing my earnings.

My forecasts were slightly optimistic, predicting gradual increases in the market price over time. While these forecasts did not yield rewards during the practice rounds, they helped me understand market trends and prepare for the main experiment.

Moving forward, I plan to refine my strategy by:
1. Adjusting my limit order prices to be more competitive and encourage trading.
2. Balancing my portfolio between stocks and cash to maximize both dividend and interest earnings.
3. Continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting my forecasts accordingly.

As we approach round 30, I will focus on selling stocks at a profit above the buyback price of 14 to maximize my earnings. The insights gained from these practice rounds will be invaluable in adapting my strategies during the main experiment.
