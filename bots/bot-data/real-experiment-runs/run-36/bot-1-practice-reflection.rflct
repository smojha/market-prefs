During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14, fluctuating slightly between 14 and 15. This stability suggests that other participants are also heavily influenced by the buyback price at the end of the experiment, which aligns with my strategy of holding stocks if the market price is at or below 14. In the first round, I successfully sold a share at the market price of 14, which helped me understand the market's willingness to buy at that price. However, in the second round, my attempt to buy back a share at a lower price of 13 was unsuccessful, indicating that the market might not be as willing to sell below the buyback price, possibly due to the potential for high dividends.

My current portfolio at the start of the third practice round includes 3 shares and 139.45 in cash, with the stock valued at 45 based on the last round's market price of 15. Given that the buyback price is 14, and considering the potential for high dividends (up to 1.0 per share per period), holding onto my shares seems advantageous, especially since the market price is just above the buyback price. This strategy could be risky if the market price falls significantly below 14, but the potential reward from dividends might outweigh the risk.

My forecasting strategy needs refinement. My forecasts for future rounds were consistently higher than the actual market prices, which suggests I may have overestimated market growth. I will need to adjust these forecasts to be more in line with the observed market stability and perhaps consider external factors that could influence price changes.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue holding stocks as long as the market price does not significantly exceed the buyback price, and I will be more cautious with my buy orders, ensuring they are competitive enough to be executed. I will also keep a close eye on market trends and adjust my strategies dynamically, especially as we approach the end of the 30 rounds, where the buyback price will become increasingly relevant.

Overall, the practice rounds have been crucial in shaping my understanding of the market dynamics and refining my trading and forecasting strategies. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, aiming to maximize my total earnings by balancing the risks and rewards of holding stocks versus keeping cash.
