During the practice rounds, I've gained valuable insights into the dynamics of the market and the effectiveness of my trading strategies. Starting with an initial portfolio of 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock, I managed to increase my cash holdings to 112.02 by the end of Practice Round 3, while maintaining 5 shares of stock. The market price has shown a slight increase from 14.0 to 15.0 over these rounds, which suggests a potential upward trend, though the volume of trades has been low, indicating limited liquidity.

In Practice Round 1, I successfully executed a buy order at the market price of 14.0, which aligns with the buyback price and indicates that this could be a stable trading point. However, in Round 2, despite submitting both buy and sell orders, no trades were executed, suggesting that the market might not be as responsive at slightly higher prices (14.5). This observation has led me to consider the importance of carefully setting limit orders to ensure they are within the market's willingness to trade.

The dividends from the stocks have varied, with earnings of 2.0 and 5.0 in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively, which underscores the unpredictability of dividend income and the need for a balanced approach between holding cash (which earns a consistent 5% interest) and stocks. As we approach the end of the practice rounds, keeping the buyback price of 14 in mind is crucial, especially when considering purchasing additional shares.

My price forecasting strategy needs refinement. My forecasts for Rounds 1 through 12 were consistently above the actual market prices, indicating a possible overestimation of future price movements. Adjusting these forecasts to be more in line with observed trends and the impact of my trades on the market price will be essential moving forward.

Looking ahead to the main experiment, I plan to continue testing the market's response to different price points and liquidity levels, while maintaining a diversified portfolio that leverages both the interest on cash and potential dividends from stocks. I will also focus on refining my forecasting model to better predict market movements and ensure that my trading decisions are informed by both current market conditions and future expectations.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the market's behavior and my trading strategies. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, aiming to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds.
