During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14.0, which influenced my trading strategy. My initial plan to test market liquidity by placing orders close to the current market price did not result in executed trades, suggesting that other participants were also cautious and possibly holding onto their shares due to the known buyback value. This reinforced the importance of considering the buyback price as a benchmark for my buying and selling decisions, especially as we approached the end of the practice rounds.

Maintaining a balanced portfolio was crucial, as evidenced by my earnings from both interest on cash and dividends from stock. The interest rate of 5% per period on cash provided a steady, albeit small, return, while the dividends from stock varied but were significant when high. This balance allowed me to benefit from both sources of income, which is a strategy I intend to continue into the main experiment.

My price forecasting during the practice rounds was based on slight increments from the current market price, assuming a potential for slight increases due to the nature of the experiment. However, the actual market prices did not deviate significantly from the buyback price, indicating that my forecasts might need more aggressive adjustments or a different approach, perhaps factoring in more historical data and market trends.

Looking forward to the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategies further. I will continue testing the market's liquidity, but with more varied order prices to see if I can initiate trades. I will also keep a keen eye on the market dynamics as they evolve, ready to adapt my strategies as needed. The insights gained from the practice rounds, particularly about the importance of the buyback price and the need for a balanced portfolio, will guide my decisions in the upcoming rounds.
