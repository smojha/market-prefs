During the practice rounds, I tested several strategies and observed the market dynamics. The Hold Strategy allowed me to collect dividends, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share, providing a steady income stream. The Buy Low, Sell High approach was challenging to execute as the market price remained close to the buyback price of 14, suggesting that other participants are also aware of the end-game value. My attempts to buy at 13 and sell at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating that the market might be too tight around this price point. The Dividend Chasing strategy seems viable as dividends contribute significantly to cash accumulation, but selling near the end will be crucial if the market price exceeds the buyback price. The Cash Accumulation strategy could be beneficial, especially with the 5% interest rate on cash, but timing the market to buy back stocks at favorable prices will require careful monitoring. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, suggesting that my understanding of market trends is improving. Moving forward, I need to remain flexible and adapt my strategies based on market movements and other participants' actions. As we approach the end of the experiment, I must be particularly vigilant about selling stocks above the buyback price to maximize earnings.
