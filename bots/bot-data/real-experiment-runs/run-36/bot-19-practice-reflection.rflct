In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, suggesting that other participants are also using this as a benchmark for trading decisions. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my pricing may need to be more aggressive to engage with the market. The dividends received were significant, with a high of 1.6 in the first round and 4.0 in the second, highlighting the potential for substantial returns from holding stocks, although this comes with the risk of receiving the lower dividend of 0.4. The interest earned on cash provides a safer but lower return, suggesting a need for a balanced approach between holding cash and stocks.

For the next rounds, I plan to adjust my trading strategy by setting more competitive buy and sell prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. I will also consider the potential of aggressive buying if the stock price falls below the expected value of future dividends and the buyback price, and aggressive selling if the market price significantly exceeds these values. My forecasts were slightly off, indicating a need for more accurate market prediction strategies, possibly by analyzing trends more closely. Overall, the practice rounds have been useful in refining my approach to maximize earnings through a combination of trading, holding, and forecasting.
