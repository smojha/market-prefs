During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my orders were not aggressive enough to engage with the market. This suggests the need for adjusting order prices closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution in future rounds.

The dividends from the stock provided a significant boost to my cash balance, with a high dividend in Round 2 contributing to a notable increase in funds. This reinforces the importance of maintaining a balanced portfolio to leverage both the potential dividends from stocks and the guaranteed interest from cash, which consistently grew my cash reserves by 5% each period.

My price forecasting was relatively accurate, especially for the short-term forecasts, which aligns well with the observed market stability. However, as we approach the end of the experiment, it will be crucial to consider the fixed buyback price of 14 when making forecasts and trading decisions, as buying stocks above this price near the end could lead to losses.

For the main experiment, I will continue to monitor the market closely, particularly around the key price of 14, and adjust my buy and sell orders to be more competitive. I will also refine my forecasting strategy to better predict market movements and use these predictions to inform my trading decisions. Reflecting on each round's outcomes will be essential to adapt and refine my approach throughout the experiment.
