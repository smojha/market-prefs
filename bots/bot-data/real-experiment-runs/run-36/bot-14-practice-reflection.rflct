During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback value of 14, which indicates a general awareness among participants of the final conversion rate. This observation supports my strategy of timing trades near the end of the experiment to maximize the benefit of the buyback price. In the first round, despite submitting a buy order at 13 and a sell order at 15, no trades were executed, suggesting that my pricing might need to be more aggressive to ensure fills. The market volume was low, which further emphasizes the need for strategic pricing to encourage trade execution.

In the second round, the market price slightly increased to 14.5, yet my orders at 13 and 15 again did not execute, reinforcing the need for price adjustments. My cash balance increased due to dividends and interest, but without trading, I couldn't test the market's liquidity or capitalize on potential price movements.

For the third practice round, with the market price at 15, I need to consider whether buying at this price is beneficial given the trade-in value of 14. Holding onto my shares until the end could be advantageous unless I can sell them at a higher price in the market before the final round.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy by:
1. Adjusting my limit order prices to be more competitive, potentially crossing the spread to ensure trade execution.
2. Monitoring market trends closely to decide when to buy or sell, particularly as we approach the final rounds.
3. Considering the potential of holding onto shares until the end to benefit from the buyback price, unless a significant market opportunity arises.

My forecasts have been increasing slightly over time, which aligns with my observation of a slowly rising market price. I will continue to refine these forecasts based on observed trends to maximize my forecast winnings.

Overall, the practice rounds have been crucial in shaping my understanding of market dynamics and the importance of strategic timing and pricing in maximizing my earnings at the end of the experiment.
