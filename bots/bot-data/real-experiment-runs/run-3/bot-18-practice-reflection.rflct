During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of balancing risk and reward in my trading decisions. I have also realized the need to adapt to changing market dynamics and make informed decisions based on the available information. Moving forward, I plan to continue experimenting with different buying and selling strategies to optimize my earnings. I will also focus on improving my price forecasting accuracy to increase my chances of earning forecast winnings. Overall, I believe that staying flexible and being strategic in my decision-making will be key to maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
