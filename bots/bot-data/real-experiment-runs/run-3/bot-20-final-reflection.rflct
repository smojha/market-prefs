Throughout the experiment, I have focused on actively trading stocks while closely monitoring market trends and making strategic decisions to maximize my earnings. I have consistently aimed to sell stocks at profitable prices and hold onto cash to secure earnings. In the final round, I successfully executed a pump-and-dump strategy by strategically buying and selling stocks to inflate the market price above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. This aggressive strategy allowed me to maximize trading volume and profit from the market bubble. Overall, I am satisfied with my performance in the experiment and believe that my proactive approach to trading has yielded positive results.
