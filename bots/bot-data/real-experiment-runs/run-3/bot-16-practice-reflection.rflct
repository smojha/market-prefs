During the practice rounds, I have been testing the strategy of buying low and selling high, while also considering the impact of holding onto stocks versus selling for cash. I have noticed the importance of monitoring market trends and patterns to make informed trading decisions. Diversifying the portfolio has been beneficial in spreading risk and potentially increasing returns. Moving forward, I will continue to adapt my strategies based on changing market dynamics and explore further diversification to maximize total earnings at the end of the experiment.
