Throughout the experiment, I have learned the importance of adapting strategies based on market conditions and maximizing dividend earnings from holding stock while also considering the trade-in value of stock at 14.00 per share. My focus on monitoring market trends closely and adjusting my trading decisions accordingly has helped me achieve a good balance between dividend earnings and interest rewards. Moving forward, I will continue to fine-tune my strategies to make the most out of each trading period and maximize my total earnings.
