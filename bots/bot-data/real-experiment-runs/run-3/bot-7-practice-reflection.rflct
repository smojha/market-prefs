During the practice rounds, I have focused on developing and testing different trading strategies. I have been actively buying and selling stocks at opportunistic prices while also paying close attention to my price forecasting accuracy. I have noticed the importance of adaptability in response to changing market conditions and the benefits of diversifying my portfolio to manage risk. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my strategies and improving my forecasting accuracy to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
