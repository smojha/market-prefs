I have been focusing on buying low and selling high as well as balancing my cash and stock holdings to optimize earnings. In the next few rounds, I plan to continue with this strategy but also consider the impact of dividend payments on each stock. I have realized the importance of diversifying my portfolio and staying informed about market trends to adjust my strategies accordingly. Overall, my goal is to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds by making strategic trading decisions.
