During the practice rounds, I have been testing aggressive and conservative trading strategies based on market data analysis. I have focused on optimizing my buying and selling decisions to capitalize on dividend earnings and interest rates. I have also closely monitored market trends and adjusted my strategies accordingly to make informed decisions that maximize my earnings. Moving forward, I will continue to refine and adjust my strategies based on the new information and insights gained from the practice rounds to ensure I am well-prepared for the main experiment rounds.
