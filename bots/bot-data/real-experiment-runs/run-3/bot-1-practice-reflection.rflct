During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of balancing my portfolio between cash and stock. I have applied a strategy of monitoring market trends and adjusting my trading decisions accordingly to maximize dividend earnings from holding stock. I have also realized the need to keep enough cash on hand for trading opportunities. Moving forward, I plan to continue with this strategy while also considering the trade-in value of stock at 14.00 per share. I will aim to make strategic buying and selling decisions to increase my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
