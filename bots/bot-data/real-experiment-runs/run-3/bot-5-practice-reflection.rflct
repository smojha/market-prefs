During the practice rounds, I have observed the importance of closely monitoring market conditions and adapting my strategies accordingly. I have realized that timing is crucial when it comes to buying and selling stock, especially considering the conversion of stock to cash at the end of the experiment. I will continue to test and refine my current strategies while also exploring new ones to maximize earnings and minimize risks. Additionally, I need to pay attention to my price forecasts and ensure they are within the allowed range to earn rewards. Overall, I aim to stay vigilant, consider all factors, and make strategic decisions to achieve the highest earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
