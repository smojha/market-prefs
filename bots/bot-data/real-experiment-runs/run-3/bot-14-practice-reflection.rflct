During the practice rounds, I focused on exploring different trading strategies to maximize earnings. I realized the importance of balancing between buying stocks for potential dividend earnings and holding onto cash for the interest reward. Moving forward, I plan to continue diversifying my portfolio and managing risks effectively. I will also pay close attention to market dynamics and adjust my strategies accordingly to adapt to changing conditions.
