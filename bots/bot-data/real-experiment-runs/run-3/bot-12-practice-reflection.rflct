During the practice rounds, I have realized the importance of closely monitoring market conditions and adapting my strategies accordingly. Timing my orders correctly will be crucial to maximizing my returns. I plan to continue testing out different buying and selling strategies based on the market data and my predictions for future prices. Additionally, I need to consider the trade-in value for STOCK and whether it is worth buying more at the current market price. Overall, I aim to optimize my total earnings by making well-informed decisions in the upcoming trading rounds.
