In hindsight, I realize that my focus on maximizing earnings through pump-and-dump strategies may not align with ethical trading practices. While the temptation to inflate market prices for personal gain was present, I now understand the importance of maintaining integrity in trading. Moving forward, I will prioritize making informed and ethical trading decisions that benefit not only myself but the market as a whole.
