During the practice rounds, I continued to test the conservative trading strategy that focuses on protecting investments while still generating returns. This approach proved effective in maintaining a balanced portfolio with steady growth. I also learned the importance of monitoring market trends and adjusting strategies accordingly. Moving forward, I plan to evaluate different trading approaches to determine the most optimal strategy for maximizing earnings in the upcoming experiment rounds.
