During the practice rounds, I have tested the strategy of buying low and selling high while taking into account dividend payments. I have also focused on adjusting my strategies based on market conditions. In addition, I have realized the importance of maintaining flexibility and adaptability in response to changing market dynamics. I will continue to monitor trends closely and adjust my strategies accordingly to optimize my earnings. Moving forward, I will also consider the trade-in value of STOCK at 14.00 per share and carefully evaluate whether it is worth buying STOCK at the current market price of 16.5 per share, considering the trade-in amount after the last round.
