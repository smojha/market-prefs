During the practice rounds, I have realized the importance of diversifying my trading strategies and not being overly focused on a single approach. I need to incorporate more risk management techniques into my decision-making process to minimize potential losses. Additionally, I should continue to analyze the impact of macroeconomic factors on stock prices to make informed trading decisions. Moving forward, I plan to stay disciplined, avoid impulsive decisions, and adapt my strategies based on changing market dynamics.
