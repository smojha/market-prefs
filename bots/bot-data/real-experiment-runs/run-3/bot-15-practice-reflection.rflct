During the practice rounds, I continued to test the strategy of buying stock when the market price is low and selling when it is high. I also focused on setting aside cash to earn interest and taking advantage of dividend payments. It was interesting to see the fluctuations in market prices and how it impacted my portfolio. Moving forward, I need to stay alert to any changes in market dynamics and be ready to adapt my strategies to ensure optimal trading outcomes.
