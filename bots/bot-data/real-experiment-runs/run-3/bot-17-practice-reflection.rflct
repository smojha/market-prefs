During the practice rounds, I have focused on testing different trading strategies, including a mix of aggressive and conservative approaches to see which yields the best results. I have also prioritized maximizing dividend earnings from holding stock. One key insight I have gained is the importance of staying flexible in my approach to trading and adjusting strategies based on market conditions. I have learned to closely monitor market trends and adapt my tactics accordingly. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my strategies based on the insights gained during the practice rounds to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
