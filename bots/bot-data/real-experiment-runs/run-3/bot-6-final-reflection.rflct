Throughout the experiment, I focused on optimizing my balance between holding cash and buying stock to maximize returns. I learned the importance of adaptability in trading and made informed decisions based on available data. In the final round, I successfully executed a pump-and-dump strategy by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price above the asset's fundamental value before selling at the peak. This strategy allowed me to profit from the market bubble and collapse. Overall, I believe I have effectively utilized the resources and information provided to me to make strategic trading decisions throughout the experiment.
