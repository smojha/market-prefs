During the practice rounds, it became evident that the stock market price has shown minimal fluctuation, consistently hovering around 14.5. This stability suggests caution in setting buy and sell limits too far from the current market price, as none of my submitted orders were executed. It would be beneficial to slightly adjust buy orders closer to the current market price, especially if the dividend yields can cover potential declines. Continually monitoring the interplay between dividend trends and price stability is crucial. Additionally, the consistent stock trade-in value of 14 serves as a benchmark; I must be cautious not to buy stocks significantly above this price unless there is clear evidence of potential for higher dividends or market price appreciation. I also observed that maintaining an adequate cash balance allows for flexibility in capturing trading opportunities, thus preserving a balance between stocking up on shares and retaining cash for future interest gains should be considered. In future rounds, I need to be more proactive in adjusting forecasts based on market data trends to capitalize on the forecast rewards.
