During the practice rounds, I've noticed that no trades were executed due to a lack of market activity within the specified price ranges. Initially, I set a buy strategy with a focus on a price of 13 and a sell strategy above 15, mainly trying to capitalize on dividend benefits and potential capital gains. Despite understanding the expected closing value of STOCK at 14, adapting this strategy to hover around this figure can lead to more active participation in executed trades. The forecasts are set with growth assumptions since the price is projected to increase gradually in the coming rounds. However, this might need adjustment based on updated market behavior, especially as the price hasnâ€™t fluctuated significantly thus far. Given the trade-in value is set at 14, buying STOCK above this value could potentially be risky, limiting the potential for gain if I can't sell at a higher price before period 30. Future strategies should focus on dynamically adjusting buy and sell limits more aggressively to ensure trades happen and potentially narrow the spread further, while simultaneously paying attention to maintaining or increasing total value through dividends and forecasts. Additionally, evaluating the market dynamics for any arising patterns or trends could inform further strategy enhancements.
