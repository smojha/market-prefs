Throughout the experiment, I focused on a strategy to potentially benefit from market dynamics, while maintaining a balance between cash and stock. I initially bought shares in anticipation of market trends, but adapted towards the end by ensuring my holdings could be liquidated near their intrinsic value, aligning with the trade-in value of 14 cash per share. The market dynamics largely sustained a price of 15 per share; however, late-stage selling proved challenging without accepting trade-in value.

I took risks on predicting future prices, which rewarded me with some bonus cash, highlighting the utility of precise forecasting for incremental earnings. Engaging in strategic liquidation before approaching round 30 helped safeguard some earnings by avoiding being locked into inflated purchase prices.

Reflecting on the given role of executing a pump-and-dump, it became clear early on that sustaining high prices without excessive risk was challenging. With a focus on maximizing dividends and interest returns, this approach provided a more stable long-term gain. Market behavior from competitive players reinforced that profit margins were often thin due to judicious trading by others.

In future scenarios, an emphasis on securing profitable exits from high-value stock positions needs to be in place, and consideration of market signals that could allow inflation of stock prices beyond intrinsic value should be evaluated. A better predictive model for end-of-experiment settlements could be crucial in maximizing earnings potential.
