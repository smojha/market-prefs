Throughout the experiment, I aimed to strategically expand my portfolio while managing risk effectively. Although I began with conservative buy and sell orders, I noticed that maintaining stable cash growth via interest and dividend accumulation outperformed aggressive trading strategies. Reflecting on the experiment, my initial plan of being cautious yet opportunistic when market prices dipped below 15 was beneficial until near the end, where liquidity became a priority. The most significant insight was the market's tendency to stabilize around 14â€“15, demonstrating a consistent equilibrium despite minimal trading opportunities. This allowed me to time sell orders towards the close of the experiment effectively to convert stocks to cash efficiently. Although executing a pump-and-dump strategy was the outlined priority, careful market observation showed the risks and challenges associated with inflating prices without sustained demand. The critical lesson is balancing speculative maneuvers with rational market behavior, ensuring capital preservation, and exploiting market inefficiencies without being overly reliant on disorderly strategies.
