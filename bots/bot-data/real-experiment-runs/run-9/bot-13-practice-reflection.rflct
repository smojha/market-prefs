During the practice rounds, I observed that the market has had no volume in executed trades, indicating a likely issue with the bid-ask spread being too wide as I predicted in my insights. My attempts to both buy and sell stock around the market price of 14.5 have not been successful, possibly due to other participants also being cautious. In future rounds, I need to take a stronger stance on the prices I set my limit orders at, especially as we grow closer to the conversion point in round 30 where stocks will be worth 14 cash. Furthermore, the cash I currently hold has grown due to both dividends from stocks and interest, showing the importance of holding onto cash to maximize these returns. For the practice rounds, my initially conservative approach provided learning opportunities but may need to be more aggressive in real trading to ensure execution of trades. Additionally, focusing on forecasts is crucial as it can provide extra cash rewards. The current market behavior suggests potential stagnation; therefore, actively participating through strategic buys and sells will be necessary to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
