During the practice rounds, I focused on placing strategic buy and sell orders close to the buyback price of 14 to understand market dynamics and the behavior of other participants. Despite not having any executed trades so far, it's evident that keeping orders around 14 may limit trading activity, as evidenced by two rounds ending without any trades. This could be due to a low market volume, indicating a lack of participant engagement or agreement on stock value beyond the buyback price. By keeping cash for interest and dividends for stocks, I realized it's essential to maintain liquidity to take advantage of price fluctuations when they occur. My forecasts have been set with slight increments over multiple rounds, anticipating gradual market movement. Going forward, I might consider slightly widening the buy-sell spread while still keeping the buyback price in mind to increase the chances of execution without taking excessive risk, particularly if signs of market activity or trends towards higher prices emerge. This would allow me to better balance the dividend and interest gains while potentially profiting from stock trades closer to expected value at experiment's end.
