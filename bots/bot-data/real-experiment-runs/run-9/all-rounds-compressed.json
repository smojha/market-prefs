Experiment with a buy price closer to 14.8 and a sell price of 15.2 to explore potential activity. Maintain focus on end-of-round stock cash conversion, plan trades as the rounds progress with this conversion in mind. Be ready to shift the strategy if market dynamics surprise any trends seen.",
            "insight": "Holding both cash and stock has currently been an effective way of earning dividend and interest. Consistent forecasting within expectations suggests that the market is stable now. However, not selling or buying assets at a volumed market suggests the need for re-evaluation of set prices to have orders filled. Aim to slightly narrow the gap in buy/sell order prices to explore potential trades. Leverage current cash position and continue adjusting strategies based on market activity.",
