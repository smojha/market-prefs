Reflecting on the practice rounds, a few key learning points have emerged. Firstly, the strategy of setting buy and sell orders slightly outside the previous market price range did not lead to any executed trades. This suggests the need for more aggressive order placement, closer to the last market price, to increase the chances of execution. Additionally, maintaining a cash reserve remains important, but failure to trade could mean missing dividend income opportunities if the stock price remains stable or grows slowly. Balancing cash reserves with active trading opportunities seems crucial to maximizing earnings. The consistent market price of 14.5 in both practice rounds indicates potential overpricing relative to the buyback value of 14, which calls for careful consideration when deciding to purchase more stock. Lastly, making accurate forecasts can be challenging, but can lead to extra cash rewards if done correctly, thus should be enhanced by closely monitoring market trends and reacting swiftly to changes.
