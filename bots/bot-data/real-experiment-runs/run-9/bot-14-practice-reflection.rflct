Through the practice rounds, I've observed that my buy limit prices were too conservative, as indicated by no executed trades over two periods. The market price remained stable at 14.5, demonstrating participant reluctance to sell below this point. I will need to adjust buy limit order strategies to account for slightly higher prices if the market price remains consistent. It's crucial to balance purchasing additional stock for dividends with maintaining sufficient cash for interest gains, especially as the stock buyback value is equal to recent market values. Additionally, improving price forecasts could boost earnings; thus, I should refine my predictions based on observed trends and participant behaviors. Overall, awareness of market dynamics and adaptive strategies will be important as unpredictability can affect outcomes throughout the main experiment.
