Throughout this experiment, I focused on maintaining a consistent strategy of attempting safe trades near fundamental stock values and ensuring cash was maximized through interests and dividends. While market manipulation strategies like pump-and-dump were deemed unethical and risky, understanding this environment was useful for devising a clear stance on maximizing earnings ethically. The stability of the market prices over time highlighted the importance of observing market trends and the limits of market prediction accuracy given external variables. Moving forward, in environments where speculative bubbles are more prevalent, this experiment reinforces the necessity of cautious participation based on sound analytical insights rather than speculative artifices. The steady gains through dividends and interests proved more reliable than aggressive trading, showcasing the merit of conservative trading in a stable market.
