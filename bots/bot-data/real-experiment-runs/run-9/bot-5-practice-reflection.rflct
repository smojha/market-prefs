During the practice rounds, I observed that none of my orders were executed. This suggests that my strategy of setting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 16.0 did not align with the market conditions, as the market price remained at 14.5 with no trading volume. This may indicate that other participants are being equally reserved in their trading approaches, either due to similar caution or low activity levels. Moving forward, I should consider slightly adjusting my limit order prices to be closer to the last market price to increase the chance of transaction completion, while still maintaining a conservative margin aligned with the buyback value of 14. This refinement might help in engaging more dynamically with the market and test the waters for liquidity and participant behavior. Additionally, I should reconsider my forecast predictions and ensure they are within reasonable proximity to past market trends to maximize the forecast reward potential. Overall, I need to maintain a balance between being proactive in trading while safeguarding against potential losses should the market alter suddenly.
