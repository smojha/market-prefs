Throughout the experiment, a consistent market price close to the trade-in value was observed, underscoring an environment of limited volatility and opportunity for significant speculative gains. Despite these conditions, adopting a speculative strategy without concrete opportunities was challenging. Attempts to manage portfolio composition by aligning buy prices near or below 14 and selling around 15 met with varied success. The stable market dynamics highlighted the importance of accurate forecasting and cash management for securing additional rewards rather than aggressive trading tactics. The final reflection notes the misalignment between the aims of a pump-and-dump strategy and the market conditions characterized by consistent pricing and limited divergence from fundamental values. Future iterations should focus on honing forecasting skills and optimizing cash interest gains, while remaining adaptable to any shifts in market behavior that might permit more speculative trading opportunities.
