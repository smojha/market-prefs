Reflecting on the practice rounds, it's evident that my strategy of setting limit orders slightly above and below the recent market range did not yield any trades. Both rounds saw zero market volume for my trades, suggesting either an illiquid market or that my buy and sell prices were not competitive enough. The market price remained stable around 14.5, while my buy and sell orders were slightly apart from this level. For future rounds, I should consider setting my buy prices closer to or slightly above the market price to potentially secure dividends, which contribute to overall earnings. Meanwhile, sell orders could be set slightly lower than before, but still consider the trade-in value of 14 to prevent losses towards the experiment's end. It's crucial to factor in both the dividends from stocks and the 5% cash interest, ensuring a balance that maximizes returns. Additionally, with the forecasts, ensuring accuracy in predictions could improve cash earnings from experiment rewards. A slight adjustment towards testing the market with smaller buy and sell increments near the known market price may increase execution likelihood, as observed from the absence of reaction to dividend announcements in others' behaviors.
