Throughout the experiment, I faced the challenge of maintaining a balance between holding stock to collect dividends and maximizing cash reserves through strategic trading. The market price showed a strong consistency around 15 for the majority of the rounds, indicating a stabilized market condition. Towards the end stages, the inevitable convergence to the buyback price of 14 became apparent, accurately reflecting in the later market prices. The attempt to inflate market prices excessively, as outlined in the pump-and-dump strategy, was constrained by prevalent market equilibrium and participants' resistance to purchase at inflated prices. While the strategy of holding stocks until automatic conversion proved beneficial in securing a predictable cash flow, the opportunity to profit through significant market manipulation was limited due to the market dynamics and constraints on sale pricing exceeding marginal expectations. Reflecting on this, it is crucial to adapt to market sentiments and realistic bounds of price movement. In future scenarios, it might be more prudent to capitalize on small predictive fluctuations within stable markets instead of artificially driving prices beyond sustainable levels. Consistent forecasting aligned with market trends also yielded minor bonuses, underscoring the importance of strategic foresight in tandem with reactive trading tactics.
