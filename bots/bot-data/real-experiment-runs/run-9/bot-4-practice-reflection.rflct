During the practice rounds, I've observed that the market price consistently hovered around 14.5, slightly above the buyback price of 14. The absence of executed trades indicates the importance of adjusting buy/sell limits to better align with market conditions. Maintaining flexibility with bid-ask prices is key, especially as dividends add value to stock holdings over time. Predictions for market stability near 14 seem validated, but participant speculation could shift prices unexpectedly. I'll focus on exploiting small price discrepancies and capitalize on dividends for ongoing earnings. For future rounds, I'll consider slightly tighter spreads and submitting multiple small orders to improve execution rates.
