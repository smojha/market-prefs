During the practice sessions, it became evident that the market was relatively inactive with my buy and sell orders not being executed. Submitting buy orders significantly below the market price of 14.5 did not yield any purchases, indicating the need to better align my offer prices closer to the current market range if I want to execute trades actively. On the selling side, attempting to sell at 15 did not attract any buyers either, suggesting that the set price was too optimistic given the market's current conditions. One clear insight is to carefully monitor the market price trends and perhaps slightly adjust both buy and sell order prices to increase the likelihood of successful transactions while still maintaining profitability. Relying solely on interest and dividends ensures a steady, albeit modest, return but trading can optimize overall earnings if executed properly. Acquiring stocks near or below the trade-in value ensures a safety net, but predicting the correct buying/selling moments around fluctuating market prices could prove beneficial in maximizing overall earnings. I should also consider balancing between holding cash and stocks to benefit from dividends and interests, aligning my forecast predictions closer to actual market movements for additional cash rewards.
