During the practice rounds, I observed that none of my submitted buy or sell orders were executed. This highlights the importance of setting realistic order prices. My initial approach of setting buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price did not succeed due to the market's lack of response, possibly suggesting a narrow trading range or lower liquidity during these particular rounds. Additionally, my forecasts for future prices were not immediately relevant to executed trades, pointing to a gap between market prediction and actionable strategy.

Key learnings include the necessity of closely monitoring market conditions and adjusting strategies accordingly. Holding too rigidly to set price points might limit potential trades, so flexibility and adaptability are critical for maximizing potential profits. The practice rounds emphasized that cash management is also vital; combining stock dividends and interest accrual bolsters overall cash flow. It might be beneficial to revise strategies to consider more aggressive and responsive order submissions, potentially involving crossing the spread at times, to ensure trades are executed when market conditions allow. Lastly, as the conversion of stock to cash at a fixed price of 14 is imminent by round 30, aligning my buying price closer to this terminal value will reduce potential losses.
