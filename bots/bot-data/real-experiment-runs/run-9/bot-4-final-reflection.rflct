Reflecting on the experiment, I aimed initially to follow a stable strategy focusing on dividends and interest earnings from both cash and stocks, while gradually adjusting holdings to maximize final returns based on given conversion values. The market remained consistent with a price aligning closely with the conversion value of 14, leading to limited trading opportunities without significant price movement. Despite the directive to pursue a 'pump-and-dump' strategy, the stable and relatively low volume markets largely impeded such drastic manipulation tactics. Executing a profitable and ethical strategy required both observing market conditions and modifying forecasts to enhance bonuses. For future iterations, I would consider seeking buying opportunities below the conversion rate earlier on, and pay closer attention to submitted forecasts, ensuring they are meticulous and flexible to enhance forecast bonuses. Overall, the key lesson learned is the importance of adapting strategies to market conditions while maintaining a focus on maximizing dividends, interests, and holding value, especially in static markets.
