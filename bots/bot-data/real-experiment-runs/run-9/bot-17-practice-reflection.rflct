During the practice rounds, it became evident that executing trades was challenging, as evidenced by the lack of executed trades in the rounds I participated in. This could be attributed to setting buy and sell orders that might not have been aggressive enough to match the market dynamics. Since the stock trade-in value is 14, my buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 were not completed, potentially due to limited market activity or wider spreads. Going forward, it seems crucial to more actively adjust pricing strategies to reflect ongoing market conditions while ensuring that buy orders are positioned at competitive rates for the stock's value near the trade-in price, especially as I approach the final rounds. Additionally, the forecasts made during the practice rounds were within a reasonable range, but it will be important to adapt these based on real-time observations for better accuracy. Accumulating cash through dividends and interest has proven to be consistent, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a cash reserve for strategic opportunities as they arise. Overall, flexibility is key, alongside leveraging insights into market behavior as the experiment progresses.
