During the practice rounds, I've observed that despite attempted limit orders, there were no executed trades due to the mismatch between the buy and sell price limits and the actual market prices. The market price seems fairly stable at around 14.5, and with the stock trade-in value being 14.00, this suggests limited movement opportunities unless market dynamics change. This reinforces the cautious approach of setting sell limits slightly above the last market price while placing buy orders slightly below the market price, potentially capitalizing on minor price fluctuations if they occur. Additionally, maintaining a cash reserve earns interest, contributing steadily to overall cash growth. This practice reflection underscores the importance of adapting strategies sure enough in case of any price trend development while acknowledging the current market stability and liquidity constraints.
