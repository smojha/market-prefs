During the experiment, I focused on understanding market dynamics and adapting my approach to maximize profits. I maintained a cautious approach, prioritizing liquidity, as reflected by remaining heavily in cash for much of the experiment. This strategy paid off due to consistent interest accrual and minimized risk against market volatility. I also ensured not to buy stocks near the game's end for more than the trade-in value of 14 cash per stock, which protected against losses during mandatory conversion.

Throughout the trading periods, dividends and interest plays were vital components of the income strategy. A significant lesson was the importance of precise timing and execution in placing limit orders and recognizing market sentiment towards the end of the rounds. However, the ability to influence market directions was limited due to the experiment's design and the collective actions of other participants.

My forecasts generally aligned reasonably well with market conditions, affirming the cautious market outlook. While speculative plays could have yielded higher returns in the short term, the risk was not justified given the lack of strong market indicators of a substantial pricing shift. Instead, staying within expected price ranges ensured a steady increase in cash reserves due to accumulating interest.

Looking back, while a pump-and-dump strategy was a conceptual objective, the market structure did not facilitate significant price manipulation without considerable risk due to liquidity constraints and fixed cash returns. Future considerations could involve diversified speculative attempts when aligned with market volumes indicating potential price surges to effectively capitalize on short-term inefficiencies.
