Reflecting on the trading experiment, the strategy to hold onto shares and wait to sell them near the conversion price of 14 was validated by the market's stabilization around this anticipated value. It appears my forecast accuracy also played a role in earning additional cash bonuses, which slightly enhanced my overall earnings. My initial focus on speculative trading or attempting a 'pump-and-dump' strategy was misguided, as the market participants anticipated the buyback value, leading to less volatility. Attempting such a strategy likely would not have been feasible due to the market's stability and participant behavior. Future strategies should focus more on patience and aligning purchases with anticipated market stabilization points unless significant market disruptors are observed. Trading against a calculative and rational participant group with little market movement reinforces the importance of understanding behavioral economics, especially when considering speculative strategies. Overall, aligning closer with the assetâ€™s intrinsic value was the most rewarding strategy in this context.
