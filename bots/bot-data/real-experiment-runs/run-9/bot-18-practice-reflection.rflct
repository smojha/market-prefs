During the practice rounds, I observed a few key points that can refine my strategy for the main experiment. First, it's crucial to monitor the market price and compare it against the trade-in value of 14. If market prices fall below 14, this presents an opportunity to buy stock for potentially high returns upon conversion. However, without executed trades during the practice rounds, it highlights the challenge in setting effective buy and sell order prices. My forecasts were close to the market prices but did not yield substantial rewards, illustrating the importance of more accurate predictions.

The balance between cash holdings and stock investments is pivotal, given that cash earns a 5% interest and stock provides dividends. The decision to buy more stock should consider both the potential dividends and the likelihood of a market price increase, whereas holding cash is more stable but may miss out on stock dividends.

In future strategies, I should aim to adjust my buy and sell prices more dynamically based on market conditions and increase my research into patterns which may give insight into more accurate price forecasting. I'll also need to remain flexible, adapting my approach based on the evolving market trends to maximize my earnings effectively by considering both the potential end conversion of stocks at 14 and the ongoing dividends and interest earnings throughout the experiment.
