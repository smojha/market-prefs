During the practice rounds, I observed that both buying and selling orders were not executed. One reason could be the narrow range between buy and sell prices in a low-volume market. It's crucial to adjust orders more dynamically to catch price fluctuations, especially with the lack of significant market activity. I need to consider the market conditions and set more realistic limits to ensure trades occur, particularly focusing on crossing the spread when necessary. Monitoring market trends will improve my forecasts and increase the likelihood of additional cash rewards from accurate price predictions. Balancing between holding cash for interest benefits and investing in stocks for dividend and potential appreciation must be prioritized. Given the practice outcomes, a more flexible strategy that adapts rapidly to market conditions will likely be beneficial in the actual experiment.
