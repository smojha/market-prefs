During the practice rounds, I found that setting the buy orders too far below the market price and sell orders too far above resulted in no executed trades. The consistent market price of 14.5 suggests that other participants may also be cautious with their spreads, leading to a lack of volume. My forecasts were close but slightly conservative, indicating a need to adjust predictions more aggressively based on market trends. The consistent dividend income and interest earnings ensured slow but steady cash growth. Moving forward, I'll aim to set tighter spreads around the market price and adjust forecasting strategies to predict slightly more fluctuating market trends. It's crucial to balance securing dividends with cash growth through interest, especially given the fixed buyback price of stock at 14, suggesting that purchasing stock above this price should be done with caution unless short-term gains are feasible.
