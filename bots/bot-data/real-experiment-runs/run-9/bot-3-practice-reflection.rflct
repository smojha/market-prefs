During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the STOCK remained stable at 14.5, leading to no executed trades given my strategy of buying at 13 or below. My forecasts were relatively close, indicating a fair understanding of the market trend. However, it's crucial to adjust buy prices slightly if necessary to engage in active trading and not solely focus on maximizing profit through extreme bargain buys. The interest earned on cash shows the benefit of holding cash, but to maximize the total earnings, participating more in trading could yield higher dividends from STOCK. Therefore, considering minor adjustments in my buying strategy to capture more dividends while still maintaining a conservative approach to avoid losses is essential as the goal is to maximize total earnings through intelligent risk-taking and adaptability to market dynamics.
