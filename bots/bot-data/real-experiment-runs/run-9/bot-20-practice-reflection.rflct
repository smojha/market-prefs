During the practice rounds, it became apparent that participant behavior has generally been conservative, as indicated by the lack of market trades and stable prices. This suggests that many participants are likely wary of overpaying for stocks given the risk of being stuck at prices higher than the share conversion value at the end. My strategy has so far aimed at being cautious by setting buy and sell orders near the market equilibrium, which is probably why no trades were executed.

From insights in the practice rounds, it seems balancing the number of stocks owned to leverage dividends and holding cash for interest is a decent approach. However, to improve trade execution chances, it might be beneficial to slightly adjust the bid and ask prices so they are more competitive but still profitable, even if slightly less so.

A key insight from the practice rounds is that while dividends and interest contribute to cash growth, they do not come as frequently as could be managed through effective trading. Therefore, a larger focus should be on predicting and reacting to market trends to capitalize on trades. My forecasts indicate a cautious bullish approach and, while broad, generally aim for a market price increase.

Going forward, adapting more dynamically to the market by perhaps observing trends across multiple rounds and adjusting forecasts and orders accordingly will be critical. While maintaining a blended portfolio, my focus will be on adjusting strategies slightly round-by-round depending on observed price movements, volume changes, and interactions with other participants to capture profit opportunities while securing asset growth through interest and dividends.
