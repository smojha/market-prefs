During the practice rounds, I observed that my limit orders were not executed, indicating that my pricing strategy may have been too conservative or misaligned with the market dynamics. The market price has remained stable at 14.5, yet my attempts to buy at 13 and sell at 15 faced no execution. This suggests the necessity of adjusting my order prices to be more competitive and aligned with market trends. Given the fixed 5% interest from cash and variable dividends from stock, my strategy should balance between securing predictable returns from cash and maximizing potential earnings from dividends and stock value appreciation. As we approach the final rounds, ensuring a sell-off price above the conversion rate of 14 will be crucial to secure additional profits. It's important to stay flexible and responsive to evolving market conditions, potentially engaging in more aggressive pricing to facilitate trade execution while keeping an eye on market price trends for my forecast predictions.
