**Practice Round Reflections:**

Across the practice rounds, my limit orders failed to execute due to a reluctance to cross the spread. In round 1, my buy order at 12 and sell order at 16 were too far from the market price of 14. In round 2, attempting to buy at 14 and sell at 14 simultaneously violated the order submission rules. 

Round 2 demonstrates the need to be more aggressive with limit order pricing to ensure execution.  Although I aimed to capitalize on perceived price discrepancies, the lack of executed trades hindered potential gains. 

Going into the experimental rounds, I need to consider submitting orders closer to or crossing the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of fills. I will also account for the final buyback price of 14 when evaluating the potential profitability of trades. The current market price in round 3 is 15, and my stock holdings are worth 90 at that price, but only 84 at the buyback price. This highlights the importance of not overpaying for stock as the final round approaches. I need to develop a strategy that balances acquiring potentially dividend-paying shares with the risk of holding stock valued above the buyback price as the experiment progresses. Additionally, I need to prioritize selling shares when the market price exceeds 14. Observing market trends will be crucial for informed decision-making.
