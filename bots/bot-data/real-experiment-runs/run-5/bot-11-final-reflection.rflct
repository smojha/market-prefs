My initial strategy involved submitting limit buy and sell orders close to the prevailing market price, aiming to profit from the dividend and interest income while minimizing the risk of holding stock. This approach proved reasonably successful in the initial rounds. 

However, as the experiment progressed, I observed that market prices tended to fluctuate around the fundamental value of 14, despite the inherent uncertainty in dividend payouts. This realization led me to shift my focus towards maximizing cash holdings, particularly as the final round approached.  Recognizing that all stock would be converted to cash at a fixed price of 14 in the final round, I decided to liquidate my stock holdings to capitalize on interest income and avoid the risk of holding stock that might depreciate below the guaranteed buyback price.

In the later rounds, I began selling my stock holdings to maximize cash, submitting sell orders slightly above the market price. Once I had completely liquidated my stock, I maintained a cash-only position, allowing my earnings to grow through interest. This strategy proved effective in the final rounds, leading to a significant increase in my overall earnings. While I briefly considered purchasing stock at discounted prices in the later rounds, the short time horizon and the guaranteed buyback price of 14 discouraged me from taking on additional risk.

In retrospect, although I did not achieve the goal of manipulating market dynamics via pump and dump, my focus on cash maximization in the final rounds was a rational and successful strategy given the experiment's rules. Had the experiment continued for more rounds, or if the final buyback price was not fixed, I would have considered exploring more complex trading strategies, potentially involving market manipulation or arbitrage.
