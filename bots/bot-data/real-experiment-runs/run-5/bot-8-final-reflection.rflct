My initial strategy involved submitting both buy and sell orders slightly above and below the previous market price to test market responsiveness and potentially profit from small fluctuations. As the experiment progressed, I observed a generally stable market around 14, with occasional upward movements.  In round 12 I started aggressively buying shares to drive up the price, but the limited availability of cash combined with the buyback price of 14 hindered my efforts.  Ultimately, I transitioned into maximizing cash holdings by selling off my stock as the price declined, recognizing that holding cash offered consistent 5% returns. While the pump and dump strategy did not work, the strategy of focusing on interest income proved the most successful path given the circumstances.
