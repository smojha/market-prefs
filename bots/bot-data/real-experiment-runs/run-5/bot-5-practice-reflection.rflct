During the practice rounds, I observed a tendency for the market price to fluctuate around the buyback price of 14. My initial strategy of placing buy and sell orders close to this price proved partially successful, with a sell order executing in round 2 at 15. However, my buy orders were not filled, indicating potential overestimation of demand at lower prices.

I also noticed that my current cash holdings have increased significantly due to interest and the sale of one stock. Moving forward, I will adjust my strategy to account for the higher cash balance. Specifically, I will consider increasing buy order prices slightly to improve the chances of execution. I will also experiment with selling shares when the market price is significantly above the buyback price to capitalize on potential arbitrage opportunities.

For the forecasting task, I consistently predicted the market price to be 14.  While this was close to the actual prices in the first two rounds, it may be necessary to refine my forecasting method for the main experiment. I will consider using past market data to identify trends or patterns that could inform my predictions.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market dynamics and informed the development of a more adaptable trading strategy for the main experiment.
