During the practice rounds, I focused on observing market behavior and testing basic buy/sell order submissions.  I consistently placed buy orders slightly below the previous market price and sell orders slightly above, attempting to gauge market depth and responsiveness.  Thus far, none of my orders have executed, indicating either insufficient market depth or overly conservative pricing on my orders. 

In the next practice round, I will try narrowing the spread between my buy and sell orders further, aiming for 14 and 16 respectively, to increase the likelihood of execution.  I will also continue observing the market price fluctuations to identify any trends or patterns.  My forecasts have consistently been 14, reflecting my initial assessment of market stability around that value.  However, given recent upward movement, I will adjust my forecasts to 15 for the next practice round.

Key observation:  Even with no trades executing, my cash balance is increasing due to the 5% interest. This highlights the importance of maximizing cash holdings as a baseline strategy.  For the real trading rounds, I need to develop a more proactive strategy that capitalizes on potential price fluctuations while managing risk. I will consider strategies that involve buying when the market price dips below 14 and selling when it goes above 14.
