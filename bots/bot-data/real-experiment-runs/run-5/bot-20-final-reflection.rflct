The overall strategy was to maximize cash holdings through a combination of dividend collection, interest accumulation, and strategic stock trading.  Initial rounds focused on maintaining stock holdings while market prices exceeded the final round buyback price of 14.  As the experiment progressed, I aimed to capitalize on price fluctuations by selling stocks when prices were favorable, and later reacquiring stock at lower prices. In the final rounds, the priority shifted entirely to maximizing cash, avoiding any stock purchases to ensure maximum return at the buyback price. The market price stabilized around 10 in the latter stages, facilitating this strategy. While market manipulation was not feasible with the limited resources, the final cash position of 637.09 suggests success in maximizing returns within the given constraints.
