Across the three practice rounds, the market price has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 14 and 15. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a narrow spread and limited trading activity.  This could be due to the practice nature of these rounds, where other participants might not be actively engaged or employing specific strategies. It is crucial to remember that the final stock value is fixed at 14, so purchasing above this price carries inherent risk, especially as the experiment progresses.  For the actual trading rounds, I should anticipate more dynamic market behavior and prepare for scenarios where price volatility increases. I need to further explore optimal buy/sell strategies, considering both the dividend payouts and the final buyback price.  Testing limit orders at various price points will be necessary to gauge market depth and reactivity.
