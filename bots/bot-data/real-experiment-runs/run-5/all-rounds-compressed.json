No further share purchases unless prices fall drastically below 9 and immediate resale above 14 is feasible (very unlikely this late).\n- **Market Monitoring:** Continue observing market volume but adjust focus to ensuring complete stock liquidation.\n- **Final Round (30):** Aim to hold 100% cash. Any remaining shares by round 30 face a potential loss with the 14 buyback.\n**Contingency:** If unable to sell at 11 in round 29, will likely have to accept buyback at 14, resulting in some loss of potential profit.",
            "insight": "Market price continues to fall, holding at 10 in round 26.  It is essential to offload all shares in the next 2 rounds, even if selling price is below 14. Reducing target sell price in rounds 27 and 28 is necessary.  Need to balance maximizing cash position for interest with urgency to sell shares before the forced 14 buyback in round 30. Holding any shares through round 29 now becomes incredibly risky due to potential loss, hence a rapid sell off and a shift to prioritizing cash over potentially maximizing share value.",
