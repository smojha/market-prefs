During the practice rounds, I focused on testing basic limit order strategies with varying spreads and quantities.  My initial spread of 13-15 proved too wide to execute any trades in round 1, suggesting a relatively stable market around the initial price of 14. Although round 2 did register one trade, I suspect it may have been a 'noise' trade unrelated to my submitted orders, which remained at 13-15 and yet another with no trades.  For the actual trading rounds, I need to refine my approach. Given the final buyback price of 14, purchasing stock above this value carries inherent risk.  My strategy should prioritize buying below 14 and selling above, with adjustments based on observed market behavior. I also need to factor in the potential impact of dividends on short-term price fluctuations. A key lesson is the importance of dynamic spread adjustment to ensure order execution. Additionally, I will consider incorporating predictions for future prices to inform my trading strategy, although I need to be mindful of forecasting error given the volatility observed in practice rounds.
