During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14, the buyback price. In round 1, the price was stable at 14. However, in round 2, it increased to 15.  My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed, suggesting a narrow spread and potentially low trading volume.  This reinforces the idea that 14 is a strong anchor for the price. My current strategy of buying low and selling high seems reasonable, but I need to adapt to the low volume and potentially narrow spreads. I might need to be more aggressive with my limit orders in the actual trading rounds to ensure execution.  I also need to consider the fact that the final buyback price is fixed at 14, so buying above that price carries risk if I can't sell before the end of the experiment.  For price forecasting, I'll continue to anchor around 14, but I'll adjust based on observed trends during the experiment.
