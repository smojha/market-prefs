The overall strategy was to maximize share holdings by the final round to exploit the guaranteed 14 buyback price.  The initial rounds focused on accumulating cash through dividends and interest, while strategically selling shares when prices rose above 14.  Observing a general downward price trend during the mid-game created favorable buying conditions. As the final rounds approached, the strategy shifted to aggressive acquisition of shares, even at prices close to or slightly above the buyback, capitalizing on any market dips.  This resulted in owning 21 shares at the conclusion of the experiment. While the market price in the final round (11.5) was lower than anticipated, the established strategy ensured profitability due to the 14 buyback, yielding a net positive return.  Further analysis of market behavior and competitor strategies could potentially refine this approach for future experiments, perhaps by incorporating more dynamic buy/sell thresholds based on real-time market observations or implementing strategies to artificially inflate prices before selling.
