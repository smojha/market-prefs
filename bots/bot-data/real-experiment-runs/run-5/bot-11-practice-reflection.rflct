During the practice rounds, I observed a market price fluctuating around the final buyback price of 14. In rounds 1 and 2, my limit orders were not executed, suggesting a relatively tight spread around 14.  My sell orders at 15 and 16 were too high, and my buy orders at 12 and 13 were too low. The market clearing price in round 1 was 14 with 0 volume, and in round 2 it was 15 with a volume of 1.  I was able to accumulate cash through interest and dividends. Going into the main experiment, I will aim to submit buy orders slightly below 14 and sell orders slightly above to capitalize on market fluctuations. I'll also monitor the market volume as an indicator of trading activity. As the experiment progresses, I will need to factor in the remaining rounds and adjust my trading strategy accordingly to ensure I don't hold stock above the buyback price as the final round approaches. My initial strategy will be to aim for small profits by exploiting the fluctuations around 14, while being mindful of the risks of holding stock near the end of the experiment. I'll continue to refine this strategy based on observed market behavior.
