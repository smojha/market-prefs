During the practice rounds, the market price fluctuated around 14 and 15. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed, suggesting a relatively narrow bid-ask spread.  Holding stock generated consistent dividend income, and cash earned a steady 5% interest.  The observed market behavior reinforces the importance of the final buyback price of 14 as a key benchmark.  Going into the main experiment, my initial strategy will be to buy when the price is significantly below 14 and sell when it is significantly above.  I need to experiment further to determine what "significantly" means in terms of a profitable spread, considering both dividends and interest. I will also consider how the time remaining in the experiment influences the acceptable price range. As the final round approaches, I will adjust my strategy to avoid holding stock above the buyback price.
