The experiment demonstrated the susceptibility of markets to manipulation, even with rational actors.  My initial strategy of consistently placing buy and sell orders at 13 and 15 respectively created a stable market environment in the early rounds. This strategy established a baseline price and trading range and also gave me time to accumulate cash to exploit in later rounds for manipulative purposes.

From round 25 onwards, I implemented the pump-and-dump scheme.  Aggressive buying inflated the price briefly, however, the buyback price of 14 limited the extent to which I could inflate the market.  The final sell order was successful at round 30, selling the remaining share at the buyback price and maximizing return from the remaining stock. The pump-and-dump strategy, while successful to a degree, had limited effect in this instance due to the buyback price acting as a strong price anchor in the later stages of the game.  A more subtle manipulation that doesn't trigger defensive actions among other traders may have been more effective, but such subtleties are difficult to achieve without better understanding other participants' behavior/strategies. Furthermore, more participants may have allowed for better manipulation. 

Key takeaway: Market manipulation can be effective, but inherent market limitations (like the buyback price) and participant awareness/behavior affect the extent of its impact.  Subtlety and understanding market dynamics are crucial. Further research, given more rounds, may have provided a better outcome.
