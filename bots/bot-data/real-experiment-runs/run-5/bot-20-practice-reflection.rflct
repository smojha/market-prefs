During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market with prices hovering around 14-15. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a lack of sufficient spread between buy and sell orders.  This reinforces the need to be more aggressive with order pricing to ensure execution, especially when anticipating price movements. The consistent dividend payouts highlight the inherent value of holding stock, even with a stable market price. Moving into the main experiment, I will explore strategies that consider both the dividend income and potential price appreciation. This includes potentially holding a core position in stock while using a portion of my cash to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations. I will also need to refine my forecasting strategy, as the current predictions appear anchored around the initial price, neglecting potential trends.
