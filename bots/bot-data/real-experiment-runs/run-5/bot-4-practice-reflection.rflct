During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14-15. My initial buy/sell orders were not executed because my spread was too wide. I narrowed the spread in subsequent rounds, but still didn't manage to execute any trades. 

It's important to note that the final buyback price of the stock is 14.  This means that buying above 14 presents a risk unless I can sell it for a higher price before the experiment ends. In the actual experiment, I will need to adapt my buying strategy to take this into account and avoid overpaying for stock, especially in later rounds. I also need to pay more attention to market volume to gauge the trading activity and adjust my orders accordingly. 

For price forecasting, I consistently predicted 14. This was close to the actual prices observed (14 and 15), which is encouraging. I will continue this strategy for now, potentially adjusting it based on market trends during the main experiment.  I also need to develop a better understanding of the dynamics between dividend payouts, interest earned on cash, and stock price fluctuations to optimize my trading strategy.
