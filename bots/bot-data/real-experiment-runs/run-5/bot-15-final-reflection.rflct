My initial strategy involved attempting to profit from the difference between the market price and the final buyback price of 14.  I submitted limit buy orders below 14 and limit sell orders above 14.  However, the market often traded at or below 14, making this strategy less effective than simply accumulating cash through interest.  

As rounds progressed, I noticed the market price trended downward. Recognizing the final buyback price of 14, I shifted to selling my initial shares when the market price was favorable. Once the price dropped significantly below 14, I attempted to exploit short-term price fluctuations while gradually liquidating my shares. This involved placing buy orders slightly below the prevailing market price and selling when small price increases occurred.

My pump and dump strategy failed.  The market did not behave as expected based on what happens with pump-and-dump in other markets.  Here, the price trended downwards after round 4 or 5 and I should have changed strategy and followed the market, selling off at 13 and later at 10.  While I made limited attempts at coordinated buying and selling, but did not generate sufficient volume or upward price momentum to create a bubble. This suggests a strong resistance to artificial price inflation within this experimental market.
