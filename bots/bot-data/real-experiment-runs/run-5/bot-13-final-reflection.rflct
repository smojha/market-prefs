My initial strategy involved submitting limit buy and sell orders slightly above and below the prevailing market price to capitalize on price fluctuations and accumulate cash through interest and dividends. However, my attempts to influence the market through strategic buying and selling, aiming for a 'pump and dump' scenario, were largely unsuccessful. Market dynamics and the behavior of other participants prevented me from effectively manipulating the price. The market remained relatively stable around the fundamental value of 14, with occasional fluctuations. I observed that other participants likely employed similar strategies, limiting the impact of individual actions on the overall market price. In the later rounds, recognizing the guaranteed buyback price of 14, I shifted my focus towards maximizing my stock holdings to capitalize on the final trade-in value.  This proved to be the most profitable approach in the given market conditions. While I didn't achieve the intended market manipulation, adapting to the stable market and focusing on the buyback mechanism yielded reasonable returns.
