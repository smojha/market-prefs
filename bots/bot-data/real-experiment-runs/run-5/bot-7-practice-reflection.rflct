During the practice rounds, I observed relatively stable market behavior with prices hovering around 14-15. Trading volume was low, suggesting a hesitancy among participants to engage actively. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, indicating a potential need to adjust my pricing strategy in future rounds.  The known buyback price of 14 seems to act as an anchor, influencing price expectations.  I will continue to monitor market dynamics and refine my strategy for the experimental rounds.  A key consideration is the trade-off between potential dividend earnings and the guaranteed buyback price of 14. Purchasing above 14 carries risk, particularly in later rounds, while buying below 14 offers a margin of safety. My initial strategy will be to buy below 14 and sell above 14, adjusting as the experiment progresses. I need to develop a more robust forecasting method, perhaps incorporating a moving average of past prices.
