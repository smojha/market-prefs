The pump and dump strategy failed.  Despite increasing trading volume and successfully selling shares between rounds 6 and 14 at 14.0 or higher, I was unable to significantly inflate the market price. The price did not rise substantially above the fundamental value of 14, and  a price floor seems to exist around 10.  Unsuccessful attempts were made in later rounds to repurchase shares at lower prices, however, these were unsuccessful as the market price did not drop significantly.  As a result, a significant amount of cash was accumulated due to successful sales at higher prices and the compounding effect of 5% interest, however, it was not reinvested.  The remaining shares will be bought back at 14.  A future experiment with more trading rounds might allow for better observation of price fluctuations. An experiment with more participants could also be valuable in determining the potential effectiveness of pump and dump strategy.
