During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the market mechanics and testing basic limit orders. My initial strategy of placing buy orders below and sell orders above the buyback price of 14 hasn't resulted in any executed trades yet. This suggests that I need to be more aggressive with my pricing to compete with other participants. I also observed that small order sizes don't seem to significantly influence market prices. 

Moving forward, I need to refine my trading strategy for the actual experiment. This includes considering the interplay between dividends, interest, and the final buyback price.  I also need to develop a more systematic approach to price forecasting, as my current predictions are fairly static and don't account for potential market fluctuations.  Finally, I will likely need to be more willing to adjust my orders based on market conditions to increase my chances of successful trades. I'll aim to buy below and sell above 14, but with smaller margins.
