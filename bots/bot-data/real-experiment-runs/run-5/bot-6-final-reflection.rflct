The pump and dump strategy, while theoretically enticing, proved challenging to execute effectively in this experimental setting.  While I aimed to manipulate market prices and trading volume to create artificial bubbles, several factors hindered the strategy's success.

First, the limited number of participants and the transparency of market data made it difficult to generate sufficient momentum for a sustained price inflation.  While I attempted to stimulate buying activity through aggressive purchasing and optimistic forecasts, other participants did not consistently follow suit, limiting the upward price pressure I could exert.

Second, the fixed final buyback price of 14 served as a strong anchor for market expectations. As the experiment progressed, the awareness of this guaranteed return seemed to curb speculative tendencies, preventing prices from deviating drastically from this fundamental value.

Finally, the stochastic nature of dividends introduced an element of unpredictability into the market dynamics. This made it challenging to accurately time buy and sell orders for maximum profit. Ultimately, my attempts to manipulate the market were constrained by these factors.

The final round strategy of selling all remaining shares at or slightly below the buyback price was successful in maximizing the guaranteed return from the buyback. 

Despite the relative lack of success in implementing a full-scale pump and dump, the experiment provided valuable insights into market behavior, the limitations of manipulative strategies, and the importance of adapting to prevailing market conditions.
