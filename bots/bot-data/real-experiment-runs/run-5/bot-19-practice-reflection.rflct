During the practice rounds, I focused on testing basic limit order strategies and observing market behavior. In round 1, my buy and sell orders were not executed, suggesting the market price hovered around 14. This is consistent with the final buyback price.  In round 2, I observed a slight increase in market price to 15 with a small volume traded. I submitted no orders to see the market's reaction. The price remaining above the buyback price is interesting. In round 3, I again did not trade, and the market price remained at 15, indicating some resistance to selling below that level.  It seems some traders might be overvaluing the stock. My initial strategy for the main experiment will be to buy when prices are at or below 14, and sell when they are significantly above 14. I also want to consider the dividend yield vs. the 5% interest in my cash holding decisions. Forecasting prices accurately could provide a significant boost to earnings, so I'll aim to refine my predictions based on early round price trends and observed trader behavior. My current forecast of 14 may be too conservative.
