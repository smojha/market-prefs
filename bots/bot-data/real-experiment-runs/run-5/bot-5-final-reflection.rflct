My initial strategy was to acquire shares at a price below 14 and hold them until the final round to profit from the buyback. However, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14 for the majority of the rounds. I began selling shares when the price rose above 14 and buying when it fell below. Around round 15, I noticed a downward trend in the market price and adjusted my strategy to maximize my cash holdings. I capitalized on the market's decline by selling off my shares as the price continued to fall, ending the experiment with a cash balance of 620.97.  While a pump and dump strategy was a stated priority, market conditions and participant behavior didn't allow for creating an artificial bubble.  The market trended downwards, so my strategy shifted to maximizing cash holdings as share prices declined.  This proved to be the most profitable approach in this particular experiment. Further analysis of other participant strategies and market fluctuations would be needed to devise a successful pump and dump strategy in future experiments.
