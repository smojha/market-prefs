My initial strategy involved gradually selling my initial stock holdings while the market price remained above the fundamental value of 14. I aimed to maximize cash holdings to benefit from the 5% interest rate. This approach was successful in the early rounds, allowing me to accumulate cash while the market fluctuated around 14-15. 

Around round 16, the market began to decline. I shifted to a buy-and-hold strategy, purchasing stocks when the price fell to 13 or below, anticipating a potential rebound or stabilization. However, the market continued to decline, reaching 10 in round 25. 

Recognizing the potential for a pump-and-dump strategy, I began aggressively buying shares in rounds 25-26, attempting to inflate demand and drive up the price. Unfortunately, this manipulation was not successful, and the market did not respond as anticipated. The aggressive purchase did however result in being over-leveraged with shares.

In rounds 27-28, I recognized the urgency to sell before the final rounds, as holding shares beyond this point would likely result in losses due to the buyback price of 14.  I aggressively sold all remaining shares in round 28 at a price of 10, minimizing potential losses. The market continued to decline slightly, reaching 10 in round 29 and recovering slightly to 11.5 in the final round. 

Overall, my strategy was partially successful in maximizing cash through interest and early stock sales. However, the attempted market manipulation failed to yield the desired results, ultimately resulting in a more conservative approach to minimize losses towards the final rounds.  An improvement to my strategy would be to better gauge the market behavior and identify more opportune moments for both buying and selling based on accurate predictions. It seems holding long positions can have significant risk even with a long timeframe in this experiment.
