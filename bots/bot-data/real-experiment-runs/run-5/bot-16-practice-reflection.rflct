Across the three practice rounds, the market price has fluctuated slightly (14, 15, 15). My limit orders designed to exploit deviations from 14 were not executed as the market stayed relatively close to this value.  This continued stability around the buyback price might mean other participants are anchoring to 14 and are reluctant to buy above it.  It could also just be the result of very small market volume. 

In the next rounds (the real experiment), I will aim to test the market's responsiveness to price changes more actively. I'll try placing buy orders slightly above and sell orders slightly below the current market price to see if I can get fills. This strategy requires careful consideration of my inventory. I need to avoid accumulating shares at a price higher than the buyback price unless there is solid evidence that the market will be willing to purchase above 14.  If buying pressure emerges and the price rises well above 14, I will consider selling some or all of my initial shares, capitalizing on the premium over the guaranteed buyback price. If the price remains stagnant near 14, holding shares is a good option thanks to dividend payments and the guaranteed return.
