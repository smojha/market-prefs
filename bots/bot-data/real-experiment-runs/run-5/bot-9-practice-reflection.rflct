During the practice rounds, I observed the market price fluctuating around 14 and 15. My initial strategy of placing limit buy orders slightly below 14 and limit sell orders slightly above 14 did not result in any executed trades. This suggests that other participants may be employing similar strategies, or the market is less volatile than anticipated. In the next rounds, I will consider adjusting my order prices to be more competitive and explore placing orders closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution.  It's crucial to remember the final stock value is 14, so buying above that poses a risk unless I can sell it for more.  I'll also analyze market volume to better understand trading activity and identify potential trends.  Finally, my forecasts have been consistently around 14-15, which seems reasonable given current market behavior, but I'll continue to monitor for any shifts.
