The experiment's structure, with a fixed final stock value of 14, significantly limited the potential for a true pump-and-dump strategy.  While the inherent randomness of the dividends and the presence of other traders created some market volatility, manipulating the price far above its fundamental value proved challenging. My initial rounds focused on understanding market dynamics and other players' behavior. The market price fluctuated around 14, occasionally deviating due to random dividend outcomes or trading activity.  Attempts to inflate the price by submitting aggressive buy orders at higher prices were largely unsuccessful, either going unfilled or leading to only temporary price increases quickly reversed by other traders. In later rounds, as the end of the experiment approached, the focus shifted towards maximizing cash holdings by liquidating stock. The market's awareness of the fixed final value prevented any significant price inflation, reinforcing the limitations of a pump-and-dump scheme in this specific environment. Ultimately, the most effective strategy turned out to be a combination of market observation, conservative trading, and maximizing cash holdings in anticipation of the fixed final stock conversion. It was also noticed that the market clearing price was not a volume-weighted average of the bid/ask spread, which would be the case for a real market.  This added extra difficulty to maximizing earnings.
