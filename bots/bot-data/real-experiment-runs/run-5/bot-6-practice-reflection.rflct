During the practice rounds, I observed relatively stable market behavior around the initial price of 14. My limit buy and sell orders at 13 and 15, respectively, were not executed in the first two rounds, suggesting a lack of aggressive trading among participants. However, the price did move to 15 in round 2, indicating some price fluctuation. 

My initial strategy of placing limit orders slightly away from the market price did not lead to any successful trades.  This suggests that in the initial rounds, playing it safe might not be the most profitable strategy. It might be worthwhile to explore more aggressive buy and sell orders closer to or even crossing the spread to potentially capitalize on small fluctuations or changes in market sentiment. For the actual experiment, I'll need to consider the trade-off between potential profits from more aggressive trading and the risk of buying high or selling low.

The current market price is 15, which is above the final buyback price of 14. This information is crucial for developing my trading strategy in the actual experiment rounds. As the experiment progresses, I'll need to be increasingly cautious about buying above 14 to avoid losses at the end. It seems the equilibrium price is around 14 given the dividend value and the 5% cash interest, hence I should focus buying below 14 and selling above 14 to ensure a profit margin and avoid loss at the end.
