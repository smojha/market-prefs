My initial strategy was to stabilize the market price around 14, slightly below the buyback price, to maximize profits from the dividend and interest payments while minimizing risk.  I placed buy orders below and sell orders above 14, anticipating that this would create a stable market. 

However, other participants' behavior drove the market price down significantly.  Around round 13, the price began to consistently fall below 14.  I started selling off my shares, recognizing that the 5% interest rate on cash was superior to the dividend return when the market price was below the buyback price and that there were not enough market participants willing to buy at or above 14.  After I sold off my shares I placed buy orders below the market price and sell orders at or above the buyback price, but those were not filled.

By the end of the experiment, the market stabilized around 10, significantly below the buyback price.  My final strategy was to maximize cash, anticipating that the market would not reach the buyback price by the end of the game and that the consistent 5% interest payments would be the most profitable strategy given these market conditions.  A pump and dump strategy was not possible given these market conditions.

This experiment highlighted the significant impact of other participants' behavior on market dynamics. Even with a clear understanding of the fundamental value of the asset, it was challenging to influence the market in the desired direction due to the unpredictable actions of other players.
