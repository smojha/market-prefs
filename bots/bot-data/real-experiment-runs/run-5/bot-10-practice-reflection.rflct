During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14-15. My limit orders in rounds 1 and 2 were not aggressive enough to execute trades, especially given the low trading volume.  I need to be more mindful of the spread and potentially cross it to ensure order execution. It seems beneficial to acquire more shares below the buyback price of 14 to guarantee profit, but selling above 14 could also be profitable if there's demand. For the actual experiment, I'll need to consider how the dynamics might shift with real incentives and a larger number of participants.  I also plan to update my price forecasting strategy to account for the small fluctuations around the buyback price.
