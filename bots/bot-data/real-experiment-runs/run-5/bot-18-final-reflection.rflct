My initial strategy was to accumulate shares at prices below 14 and sell them closer to the final round when I anticipated the price might rise due to the fixed buyback. I maintained buy orders around 13 and sell orders slightly above the prevailing market price. However, the market didn't behave as I expected, with the price remaining relatively stable around 14 and then declining in later rounds. 

Around round 12, I noticed the price hovering around 14 and decided to start selling my shares to capitalize on the guaranteed buyback price. By round 15, I had sold all my initial shares. Observing the price falling below 14 in subsequent rounds, I began accumulating shares again, anticipating a potential price increase closer to the end of the experiment. I attempted to maximize my profit by placing buy orders at lower prices (around 10-12) and accumulating a significant number of shares.

Unfortunately, my attempt to capitalize on the price difference near the end wasn't as successful as I had hoped.  The market price remained lower than the buyback price, and while I held a substantial number of shares, my overall profit was limited by the final market price. My aggressive buying in the later rounds increased the trading volume but did not inflate the market price sufficiently for a substantial 'pump and dump' profit.

Key takeaway: While the fixed buyback provided a baseline value, market dynamics and other participants' behavior played a crucial role in determining profitability.  A more sophisticated strategy, perhaps involving earlier manipulation to drive the price higher, might have been necessary for a successful pump and dump in this environment.  Understanding and reacting to the evolving market conditions, especially other players' actions, proved more challenging than anticipated.
