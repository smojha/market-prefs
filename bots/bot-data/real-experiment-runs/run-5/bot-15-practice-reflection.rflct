During the practice rounds, I observed the market price fluctuate around 14-15.  My limit orders were not filled, suggesting that the spread between buy and sell orders may be wider than anticipated.  I will continue to monitor market behavior and adjust my trading strategy accordingly.  I may need to be more aggressive with my limit orders to ensure they are filled. It appears that the buy and hold strategy may be a good starting point with incremental adjustments if and as arbitrage opportunities present themselves.
