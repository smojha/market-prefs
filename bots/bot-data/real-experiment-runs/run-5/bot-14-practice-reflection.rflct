During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price hovering around 14-15. My limit orders in rounds 1 and 2 were not executed, suggesting they were too far from the prevailing market price. In round 2, I adjusted my orders slightly closer to the observed market price (buy at 12, sell at 15), but they still weren't filled.  This indicates that I may need to be more aggressive with my order pricing to ensure execution, especially if I want to increase my stock holdings. The market volume remains low, which might contribute to the difficulty in getting orders filled. Moving forward into the experimental rounds, I will continue to observe market trends and adjust my limit orders dynamically, potentially narrowing the gap between buy and sell prices to increase the likelihood of trades.  I also need to consider the final buyback price of 14 when placing buy orders to avoid potential losses.
