During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14-15. My initial strategy of placing buy orders below and sell orders above the market price resulted in no trades in round 1. In round 2, I successfully bought 1 share at 15, indicating that buying closer to or at the market price is more likely to result in executed trades. I also noticed that my sell order at 13 was invalid as sell order prices must be above the buy orders.  Going forward, I plan to place limit orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of execution. I will also aim to capitalize on price fluctuations by buying low and selling high, keeping in mind the final buyback price of 14. My current stock holdings are slightly above the buyback price, so I'll consider selling if the price increases further or holding if it drops closer to 14.  I need to pay closer attention to constructing valid orders to avoid wasting opportunities. It's crucial to adapt my strategy based on real-time market behavior, including the volume of trades, to maximize my earnings.
