My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, attempting to profit from the fluctuations in market price and the dividend payouts.  However, I observed that the market price often hovered around 14, likely influenced by the final buyback price. My submitted buy and sell orders were rarely executed, suggesting a tight market with limited opportunities for arbitrage. In round 8, I successfully sold all my shares at 14.  From then on, I focused on accumulating cash through interest, recognizing the difficulty of accurately predicting market behavior and the limited potential for substantial profits through trading given the constraints and the apparent market efficiency.  I was unable to execute a pump and dump strategy due to the market dynamics and trading limitations of the experiment.  Focusing on interest accumulation proved to be the most reliable approach, resulting in a final cash balance of 596.07.
