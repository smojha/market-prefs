My overall strategy was to accumulate cash early on, and then buy low and sell high when the opportunity presented itself. In the later rounds, I anticipated the price decline and attempted to capitalize on it by selling shares. The aggressive buying at low prices in the final round, intended to maximize profit from the buyback price, did not execute as planned as the market price did not go below the buyback price of 14. A key learning from this experiment is the importance of adapting to market dynamics and the behavior of other participants. The market didn't behave as predictably as I had hoped, and my final round strategy, while successful in previous experiments, didn't yield the expected results this time. It's clear that a deeper understanding of market sentiment and participant behavior is crucial for maximizing gains in this environment. For future experiments, I would prioritize developing a more robust strategy for the final rounds that accounts for the potential unpredictability of the market and adjusts accordingly, possibly involving larger volume orders earlier in the final rounds to capitalize on price fluctuations before the very last round. This would involve close monitoring of market trends throughout the experiment to better predict and react to price changes.
