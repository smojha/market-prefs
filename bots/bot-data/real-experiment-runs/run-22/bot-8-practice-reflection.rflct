During the practice rounds, I observed that my initial strategy failed to execute any trades as my buy and sell orders were not competitive enough within the market. The market prices of 15 and 16 in rounds 1 and 2 respectively did not allow for trades given my planned buy at 13-14 and sell at 15-16. I need to adjust my buy order to be more aligned with prevailing market prices if I want to successfully purchase shares. Conversely, my sell orders need to better anticipate slight market increases to ensure they're executed. Additionally, dividends were relatively consistent, emphasizing the advantage of holding stocks; however, balancing cash to take advantage of the 5% interest return ensured healthy cash growth. In forecasting, I was somewhat accurate but need to refine my understanding of market patterns to further bolster price predictions. Going forward, a better balance between competitive positioning and strategic forecasting will be necessary.
