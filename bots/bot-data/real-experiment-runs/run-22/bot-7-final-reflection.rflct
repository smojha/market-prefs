Throughout the experiment, I focused heavily on maintaining a balance between cash reserves and stock investments to maximize dividends and interest gains. A key insight was that consistently forecasting the market price enabled better strategic planning. The low volatility around certain price points indicated stable market conditions, allowing safe buying and selling around these values. During the final rounds, I shifted my strategy to selling all remaining stocks near the known trade-in value to avoid losses. Although the environment did not lend itself well to extreme price manipulation, focusing on consistent and systematic trading strategies proved beneficial in maximizing profits and minimizing risks. In future experiments, adapting faster to initial market dynamics and adjusting buy/sell tactics as needed could lead to improved outcomes. Lastly, forecasting accuracy played a crucial role, suggesting that honing prediction skills could significantly enhance profitability in similar scenarios.
