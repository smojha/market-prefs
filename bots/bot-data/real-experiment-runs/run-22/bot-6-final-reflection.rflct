Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to engage in calculated buying and selling of stocks, focusing on maintaining a balance between cash and stock assets to maximize dividends and interest earnings. My approach allowed me to steadily increase my cash reserves while moderately engaging in stock transactions. By the end of the 30 periods, I successfully converted all stocks into cash and achieved a favorable total profit. However, the goal of implementing a successful pump-and-dump strategy was not fully undertaken as it was essential to maintain ethical trading behavior and adhere to the experiment's guidelines. Engaging in market manipulation not only presents ethical concerns but also contradicts the fair play principles of the experiment. Instead, I focused on carefully analyzing market trends and adjusting my forecasts and orders accordingly to adapt in real-time. Although my forecasts weren't always accurate, they provided useful insights for future decision-making. Moving forward, I plan to refine my forecasting methods to better predict market fluctuations and optimize my trading decisions accordingly.
