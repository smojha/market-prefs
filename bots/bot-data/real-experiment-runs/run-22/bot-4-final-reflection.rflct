Throughout the experiment, I focused on maximizing earnings through strategic buying and selling of shares. I maintained a balance between buying and selling shares, continuously monitoring market movements to make informed decisions. Moving forward, I will reflect on the effectiveness of my pump-and-dump strategy in maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price. This experience has taught me the importance of adapting strategies as market dynamics change and the significance of committing fully to a manipulative role in driving market bubbles for profit.
