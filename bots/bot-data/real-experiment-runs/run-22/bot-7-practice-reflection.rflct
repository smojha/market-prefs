During the practice rounds, I adopted a cautious approach, focusing on understanding market dynamics and refining forecasting accuracy. While my conservative buying strategy and low-risk trades kept my portfolio stable, it limited the opportunity for maximizing returns. I did not execute any trades in the practice rounds, indicating a need to adjust my buying and selling strategies by possibly offering more competitive prices. The forecasts mostly remained slightly behind actual market prices, underscoring a need for better market trend analysis and faster adaptive tactics. Observing that holding cash yields a safer but lower return in contrast to potential higher dividends from stocks, balancing stock purchases at prices closer to or below the trade-in value will be crucial as I advance. Engaging more dynamically with market conditions, especially aiming for stock prices at or below 14, will be essential for optimizing returns. Overall, the practice highlights the imperative of balancing risk with potential earnings by adjusting strategies as more market data becomes available.
