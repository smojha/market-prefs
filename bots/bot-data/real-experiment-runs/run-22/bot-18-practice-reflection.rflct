During the practice rounds, I focused on selling shares to increase my cash holdings, which proved to be a beneficial strategy given the high market prices relative to the dividend earnings. The market price in the first practice round was 15.0, which was higher than the expected dividend per share. This reinforced the idea that holding cash might be more advantageous, especially if the stock price remains volatile. In the second round, the market price increased to 16.0, and I continued to sell shares, successfully executing a sell order at this price. This strategy allowed me to accumulate more cash, which earns a fixed interest rate of 5% each period. My current cash holdings are 187.56, and I have zero shares of stock. Given the market dynamics observed in the practice rounds, I plan to continue focusing on cash accumulation while monitoring the market price and dividend closely. I will consider buying shares if the price drops significantly and if it aligns with the expected dividend earnings. Adapting strategies based on market dynamics will be crucial for maximizing earnings in the main experiment.
