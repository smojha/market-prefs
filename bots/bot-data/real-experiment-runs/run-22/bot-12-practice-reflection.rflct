During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the basic market mechanics and testing limit orders. 

**Observations:**
* Market price showed an upward trend, rising from 15 to 16 in the first two rounds. This might suggest early optimism but the final buyback price of 14 should anchor the price eventually. 
* My sell order at 15 executed in round 1 but the buy order at 14 in round 2 did not execute. This suggests a need for a more dynamic pricing strategy and potentially crossing the spread at times. 
* The dividend payout introduces an element of randomness, affecting returns from holding stock. It's crucial to factor this in when evaluating potential buy/sell prices.

**Strategy Refinements for Main Experiment:**
* **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement a more adaptive approach to pricing orders.  Consider the spread, market trends, and proximity to round 30 when setting buy/sell limits. Don't be afraid to cross the spread if needed. 
* **Dividend Consideration:** Factor in the expected dividend return when calculating the total return from holding the stock. 
* **Endgame Strategy:**  Develop a plan for rounds 25-30 to maximize returns, taking into account the fixed buyback price of 14 and potential for difficulty selling as the end nears. 
* **Opponent Modeling:**  Observe other players' behavior to try and anticipate market trends and potential opportunities. 
* **Forecasting Improvement:**  Need to develop a more robust forecasting model, perhaps using moving averages or other indicators.  

**Next Steps:** Analyze market data from the practice rounds more thoroughly. Develop specific algorithms for setting buy/sell prices based on current market conditions, expected dividend, and remaining rounds. Design a forecasting strategy.
