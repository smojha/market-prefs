During the practice rounds, I noticed several key points that will be crucial for maximizing earnings in the main experiment. Firstly, the market price can fluctuate significantly, and there is a notable premium over the buyback price of 14.0, indicating that participants are willing to pay more for potential dividends. This could be a strategic opportunity to sell stocks at a higher price. Secondly, dividends and interest earnings can have a substantial impact on cash holdings. It is essential to balance the portfolio between holding cash for interest and holding stocks for dividends. Thirdly, adaptability in trading strategies is crucial as market dynamics can change rapidly. It is important to monitor the market closely and adjust orders accordingly. For future rounds, I plan to be more aggressive in buying stocks when the price is below the buyback price and selling when the price is significantly above it. Additionally, I will focus on improving my price forecasting to earn more rewards. Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights that will help in making better decisions during the main experiment.
