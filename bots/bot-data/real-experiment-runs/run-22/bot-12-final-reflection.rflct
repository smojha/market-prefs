My initial strategy involved alternating buy and sell orders slightly above and below the previous market price to test the market's responsiveness and potentially profit from small fluctuations.  I attempted to increase my stock holdings when prices were favorable, anticipating higher dividends, but also wanted to capitalize on price increases by selling. However, the market stabilized around 14-16, limiting the effectiveness of this strategy.  

Around round 6, I briefly shifted to accumulating more stock, hoping to drive up demand and price. This was moderately successful, but the market quickly corrected itself.  From rounds 10-20 I focused on accumulating cash, recognizing that consistent interest accumulation might be a more reliable strategy than unpredictable market fluctuations.  I shifted to buying stock at or near 14, attempting to maximize my share holdings for the 14 cash conversion at the end, in rounds 22 through 28. Although it appeared other participants pursued a similar strategy, my available cash allowed some accumulation at favorable prices. 

My price forecasting strategy was to predict 14-16 throughout the experiment, as the price tended to remain within that range. Though this generated some forecast bonus, the primary profit driver was interest accumulation and stock conversion. The final round's price of 14 validated the final phase of my strategy, maximizing the return on my stock holdings. Despite the "pump and dump" prompt, the market mechanics and other participants' behavior didn't appear conducive to such manipulation, leading to a more conservative approach focusing on consistent returns.
