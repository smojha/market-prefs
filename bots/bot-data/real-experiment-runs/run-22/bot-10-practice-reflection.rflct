During the practice rounds, I observed a general upward trend in the market price, rising from 15 to 16. My sell orders at the market price were consistently filled in round 1, while buy orders significantly below market price were not. In round 2, neither buy nor sell orders were filled. This suggests some participants are willing to buy above 15, but possibly not as many are willing to buy at 16.  

My initial strategy of placing limit orders slightly above and below the previous market price seems reasonable, but needs refinement. I need to better anticipate the market's direction to ensure order execution. Currently holding 3 shares and the buyback price is 14.  I should avoid purchasing shares significantly higher than that, considering the final conversion. Given the upward trend, it might be worth considering selling shares if the price rises further, especially as it approaches and surpasses the final conversion rate of 14. This would maximize potential profit while mitigating the risk of holding the stock until the end.
