During the practice rounds, I observed that placing buy orders slightly below the market price did not result in any executed trades. This suggests that the current market trend is either stable or slightly upward, making it difficult to purchase shares at a discount. Additionally, my sell order at a slightly higher price did not execute, which further indicates that market prices are either stagnating or my pricing strategy needs adjustment. Moving forward, I will need to adapt my buying strategy by potentially crossing the spread more frequently, especially if I perceive an upward trend in market prices. Furthermore, anticipating that stock will be converted to 14 at the end, I must remain cautious about purchasing stocks at prices above this threshold as we approach the later rounds. Accurate forecasting is also essential, as successful predictions provide additional cash bonuses. I will focus on market momentum and past price trends to refine my forecasts in the real experiment.
