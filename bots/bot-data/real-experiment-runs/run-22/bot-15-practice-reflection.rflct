During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 15 and 16, which suggests a relatively stable market environment. My strategy of selling one share at the market price of 15 in the first round was successful, increasing my cash reserves and allowing me to benefit from the interest rate. However, the decision not to buy in the second round when the price rose to 16 might have been a missed opportunity, especially considering the stock's fixed buyback value of 14 at the end of the experiment. This indicates that I should be more willing to buy stocks when the market price is close to or below the buyback price, as it could lead to a profit upon conversion.

My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which is encouraging for potential rewards at the end of the experiment. I need to continue refining these forecasts by closely monitoring short-term trends and historical data to stay within the 2.5-unit margin for accuracy.

In terms of portfolio management, maintaining a balance between cash and stocks is crucial. The dividends and interest earnings have been significant, and I should consider these in my strategy to optimize my cash flow. Given the buyback price of 14 per share, it's important not to overpay for stocks as the experiment nears its end, to avoid losses upon conversion.

For the upcoming rounds, I will adjust my strategy to be more aggressive in buying stocks when the price is at or below 14, while also ensuring I have enough cash to benefit from the interest rate. I will continue to test market liquidity with varied orders and refine my price forecasts based on recent market data to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
