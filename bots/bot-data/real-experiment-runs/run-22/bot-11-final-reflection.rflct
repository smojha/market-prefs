My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the dividend payouts and interest earned on cash.  However, I quickly noticed the market price tended to stabilize around 14-16, likely influenced by the final buyback price of 14. 

Despite attempting to influence the market in earlier rounds through strategic buy and sell orders,  creating a significant price bubble proved difficult.  Other participants seemed to be anchored to the buyback price, limiting the potential for extreme price fluctuations.  My efforts to "pump and dump" were unsuccessful as I couldn't create sufficient market momentum.  The predictable nature of the dividend (either 0.4 or 1.0) also contributed to this stability.

Towards the latter half of the experiment, I focused on maximizing cash holdings by selling any remaining stock, recognizing the limited profit potential from price appreciation and the risk of holding stock beyond the buyback value as the final round approached. My final strategy focused on cash accumulation and secured a reasonable profit through interest earnings and forecast bonuses. The experiment highlighted the difficulty of manipulating a market where participants are aware of the underlying asset value and the limited timeframe for exponential growth.
