During the practice rounds, I observed a general upward trend in market price, rising from 15 to 16. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting that my spread was too wide.  I will need to adjust my strategy to be more competitive in the market while also being mindful of the final buyback price of 14.  Holding stock has provided dividend income, which has been beneficial, but I need to be cautious about overpaying for stock as the experiment progresses.  I will aim to refine my pricing strategy for the main experiment to maximize profit, taking into account the dividend payments, interest earned on cash, and the fixed buyback price. A key lesson is the importance of balancing aggressive bidding/selling with the risk of not executing trades. The upward trend may not continue, so I will avoid becoming overconfident.  I will also consider the potential influence of other participants and their strategies.
