Based on my practice experience, here are key learnings and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Price Analysis & Fundamental Value:
- The fundamental value of stock should consider both expected dividends (0.7 per period) and the final buyback price (14)
- Market prices above 14 near the end of trading create risk since shares will be converted at 14
- Current market price of 16 seems slightly high given fundamentals

2. Trading Strategy:
- Successfully sold 1 share at 16 which was profitable given the buyback value of 14
- Conservative approach in early rounds helped maintain flexibility
- Important to maintain some stock position for dividend income while having cash for opportunities

3. Risk Management:
- Cash provides guaranteed 5% return vs variable stock dividends
- Need to carefully track total position value (shares Ã— buyback price + cash)
- Avoid holding too many shares near experiment end due to buyback risk

4. Market Dynamics:
- Other traders may not always act rationally
- Some price volatility exists (15 to 16 range observed)
- Limited trading volume suggests need for patience in execution

5. Future Focus:
- Continue monitoring fundamental value vs market price
- Look for opportunities to sell above buyback value
- Maintain balanced position between stock and cash
- Be more aggressive in price forecasting within observed ranges
