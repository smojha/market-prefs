During the practice rounds, I have been testing different buying and selling strategies while closely monitoring market trends. I have also been considering the balance between holding onto stock for dividends and selling at the right time to maximize profits. Moving forward, I will continue to adjust my plans based on new information and aim to make informed decisions to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
