The strategy focused on accumulating cash through conservative trading in the early and mid-game, capitalizing on price fluctuations around the fundamental value of 14.  While opportunities for buying low and selling high existed, the market generally remained stable, limiting the potential for large profits from short-term trades. As the experiment progressed, the focus shifted to maximizing cash holdings, recognizing the guaranteed 14 CASH conversion at the end. This approach proved effective, resulting in a final cash balance of 702.77.  Although a pump-and-dump strategy was the stated 'top priority,' the market dynamics and other players' behavior did not present a feasible opportunity to execute such a maneuver. The relatively stable market price around 14, coupled with the known end-game conversion rate, likely disincentivized other participants from engaging in speculative buying that would be necessary to inflate a bubble. Therefore, the strategy prioritized consistent, low-risk gains from trading within the established price range and ultimately maximizing cash reserves for the final conversion.
