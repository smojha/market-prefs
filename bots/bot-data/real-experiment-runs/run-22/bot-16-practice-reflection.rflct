During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 15.0 and increased to 16.0, indicating a slight upward trend. My strategy of placing buy orders below the market price at 13.0 and 14.0 did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that other participants were either holding similar valuations or were not willing to sell at those prices. This highlights the importance of understanding market sentiment and possibly adjusting my order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution.

The dividends and interest earned were significant, contributing to my cash reserves. This reinforces the need to consider these earnings in my investment decisions, balancing the potential returns from stock ownership with the steady growth of cash through interest.

The buyback price of 14.0 at the end of the experiment provides a clear benchmark for the stock's value. Given that the market price in the last practice round was 16.0, it suggests that there may be an opportunity to sell shares at a profit before the final round. However, the decision to buy more shares at the current market price should be carefully weighed against the buyback value.

My price forecasts were based on the observed trends and market data, but none of them were within the 2.5-unit range of the actual prices. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting approach, possibly by incorporating more historical data and adjusting for potential market volatility.

Moving forward, I plan to maintain a conservative approach but be more aggressive in adjusting my buy and sell orders to align more closely with market prices. I will continue to monitor the market closely, adapt my strategies based on new data, and ensure that my cash reserves are sufficient to capitalize on potential buying opportunities while also considering the buyback value of the stock.
