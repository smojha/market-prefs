During the practice rounds, I've learned that setting my buy and sell prices too conservatively may result in no executed trades, as seen in both rounds 1 and 2. While forecasting correctly helps with additional cash rewards, improving trade execution should be prioritized for maximizing overall earnings. The stability of dividends and interest payments provides a safety net, but adjustments in trade strategy are necessary to capitalize on market opportunities. A slight increase in aggressiveness for future order submissions could help achieve successful trades while keeping an eye on conversion risks associated with overpaying for stocks as we approach the final rounds. Additionally, maintaining balanced forecasts is important for cash rewards, underscoring the need to recognize the consistency and potential trends in market prices. Moving forward, I will aim to challenge my comfort zone in placing dynamic trade offers that align with market conditions to optimize returns.
