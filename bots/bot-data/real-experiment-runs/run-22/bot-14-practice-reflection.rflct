During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock started at 15.0 and increased to 16.0 by the second round, suggesting a slight upward trend. My strategy of submitting buy orders at prices below the current market price (13.0 and 14.0) did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market prices were stable and possibly influenced by other participants' cautious trading behaviors. This aligns with my insight that there is cautious trading among participants, possibly waiting for clearer trends.

Given that the stock's buyback value at the end of the experiment is fixed at 14.0, it seems prudent to consider buying more stocks if the price dips below this threshold, as outlined in my plans. The dividends received (4.0 in the first round and 1.6 in the second) add value to holding stocks, which supports the strategy of holding onto existing stocks unless a significant price increase is anticipated.

My current cash position increased due to interest earnings (5.0 in the first round and 5.45 in the second), which is beneficial but needs to be weighed against the potential gains from stock price appreciation and dividends. The forecasts I made were generally conservative and aimed at staying within the 2.5-unit range for potential rewards, which I will continue to refine based on emerging market trends.

Looking forward, I plan to monitor the market closely and adjust my trading strategy accordingly. If the market price remains stable or decreases, I will consider more aggressive buy orders to increase my stock holdings, especially if the price approaches or falls below the buyback value of 14.0. I will also continue to use my price forecasts to inform my trading decisions, ensuring they are as accurate as possible to maximize my forecast winnings at the end of the experiment.
