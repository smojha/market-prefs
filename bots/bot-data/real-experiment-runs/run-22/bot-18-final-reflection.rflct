Throughout the experiment, my strategy evolved significantly. Initially, I focused on holding cash and earning interest, which proved to be a stable and profitable approach. However, as I progressed through the rounds, I realized the importance of adapting to market dynamics and forecasting market prices accurately to maximize earnings. My strategy of holding cash and avoiding stock purchases, especially considering the stable market price around 14.0, allowed me to accumulate a substantial amount of cash. The practice rounds were instrumental in refining my approach and understanding the market's behavior. The lack of successful trades in the main experiment rounds highlighted the need for more aggressive strategies, particularly in the final rounds. In hindsight, I should have attempted more aggressive buy orders to increase my stock holdings and potentially sell at a higher price before the final round. The consistent market price of 14.0 in the final rounds reinforced the strategy of not buying stocks near the end, as they would be converted at the buyback price of 14.0 regardless. Overall, the experiment underscored the importance of adaptability, accurate forecasting, and strategic decision-making in maximizing earnings.
