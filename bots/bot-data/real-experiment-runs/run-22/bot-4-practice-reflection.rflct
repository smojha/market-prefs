In reviewing my practice rounds, I can see that my strategies focused on buying/selling stock based on dividend potential and market price fluctuations. I also paid attention to accurate price forecasting to earn rewards. Moving forward, I plan to continue these strategies and also consider the balance between dividend earnings from stock and interest from cash. I will stay informed on market trends to make more strategic trading decisions and analyze market price movements for potential patterns or trends. Overall, I aim to maximize my total earnings by optimizing my trading decisions and adapting my strategies as needed.
