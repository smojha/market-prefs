Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Fundamental Value Analysis:
- The stock's fundamental value should decline each period as we get closer to the final buyback at 14
- Currently at round 3, stock is trading at 16 which is above the buyback value of 14
- Need to be increasingly cautious about buying above 14 as we approach later rounds

2. Trading Strategy Performance:
- Successfully executed buy orders at 15 in round 1, increasing position to 7 shares
- More aggressive orders (sell at 17, buy at 13) in round 2 didn't execute, suggesting need to price closer to market
- Portfolio is currently heavy on stock (7 shares) relative to cash position

3. Income Streams:
- Dividend payments varied significantly (7.0 vs 2.8) showing the impact of high/low draws
- Interest earnings growing (2.75 to 3.24) as cash position increases
- Combined dividend/interest providing steady income stream

4. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Should consider reducing stock position while price remains above buyback value
- Need to price orders closer to market to improve execution probability
- Important to maintain sufficient cash buffer for opportunistic purchases
- Price forecasts should trend down toward buyback value in later rounds

For future rounds, I will focus on:
- Gradually reducing exposure when price is above fundamental value
- Setting more realistic limit order prices to improve execution
- Maintaining better balance between stock and cash positions
- Considering time remaining until buyback in all decisions
