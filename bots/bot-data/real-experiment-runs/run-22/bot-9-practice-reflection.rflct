During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around 14-16. My initial strategy of buying below 14 and selling above 14 was partially successful. In round 1, I successfully sold 1 share at 15, but in round 2, my buy order at 13 and sell order at 17 were not executed. This suggests that other participants may have similar strategies and the market may be competitive. I need to refine my approach to better anticipate market movements and improve order execution. Specifically, I will try to place more competitive buy orders slightly above the current market price when it is low (around 14) and sell orders slightly below the current market price when it is above 14. I will also aim to collect data on trading volume and adjust the number of shares I am willing to buy/sell accordingly to ensure order fulfillment.  Furthermore, as the final round approaches, I should be increasingly hesitant to buy above 14 and more eager to sell even below 14 to avoid losses from the buyback price.
