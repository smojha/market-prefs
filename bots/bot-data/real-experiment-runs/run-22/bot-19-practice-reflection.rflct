During the practice rounds, I noticed that my orders were not aggressive enough to execute any trades. The market price has been fluctuating, and my bids were not competitive. I need to adjust my bidding strategy to be more in line with market conditions. Given the high dividend yield compared to the interest on cash, holding stock seems more profitable. However, I must be cautious as I approach the final rounds, considering the trade-in value of 14 per share. For future rounds, I plan to be more aggressive in my buying strategy, especially if the market price drops below 14. I will also consider selling some stock if the price rises significantly above the trade-in value to lock in profits. For price forecasting, I will continue to predict slightly higher prices based on current trends but will adjust my forecasts as market dynamics change.
