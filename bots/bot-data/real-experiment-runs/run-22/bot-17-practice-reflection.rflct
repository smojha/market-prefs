During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 15 and 16, which is higher than the initial buyback price of 14. This suggests that there might be an upward trend in the early rounds. I attempted to buy shares at a lower price and sell at a higher price, but none of my orders were executed. This could indicate that the market is more competitive than initially expected, and I need to be more aggressive with my pricing to get fills on my orders. Holding onto cash provided a stable return, and the dividends from the shares were significant, especially when earning 1.0 cash per unit. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my strategy by being more aggressive with my buy and sell orders to ensure they get executed. I will also continue to monitor market dynamics closely and refine my forecasting strategies based on observed price trends. Additionally, I will consider the buyback price of 14 when making decisions, especially as the rounds progress closer to the end of the experiment.
