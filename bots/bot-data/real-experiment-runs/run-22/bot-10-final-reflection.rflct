My initial strategy involved attempting to capitalize on market fluctuations by submitting both buy and sell orders each round.  However, the market quickly stabilized around 14-15, and the low volume made it challenging to execute trades consistently.  Due to this, I primarily earned profits through interest and high dividends. 

My price predictions were generally accurate, clustering around the 14-15 range which reflected the market's consistent behavior. However, forecast bonuses made a negligible contribution to my final earnings.

Towards the later rounds, observing the consistent market price around 14, I shifted my strategy to maximize share acquisition at or below the buyback price of 14.  This strategy, executed in the last few rounds, proved successful and increased the final trade-in value of my shares.

Despite attempting to execute a pump and dump strategy, the dynamics of this specific market (with other participants and fixed buyback price) did not make it feasible.  The most impactful element of my strategy for this experiment was adapting to the market price stabilization and focusing on share acquisition towards the end.
