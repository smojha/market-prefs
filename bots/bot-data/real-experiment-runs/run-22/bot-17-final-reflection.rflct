Throughout the experiment, I employed a conservative approach by holding cash to earn interest and avoiding risky trades. This strategy proved effective, especially in the later rounds where the market price stabilized around 14. By focusing on earning interest and making accurate price forecasts, I ensured a steady increase in my cash holdings. The market data indicates that my predictions were often within the reward range, contributing to additional rewards. In the final rounds, I successfully sold all my shares, avoiding the risk of holding them at the trade-in value of 14. My final cash amount of 695.21 and the total payment of $15.54 reflect the effectiveness of my strategy. For future experiments, I would continue to prioritize accurate forecasting and conservative trading, especially towards the end of the experiment.
