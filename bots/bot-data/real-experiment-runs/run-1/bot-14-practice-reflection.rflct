During the practice rounds, I focused on testing various buying and selling strategies to determine the most profitable ones. I also emphasized refining my price forecasting accuracy to maximize earnings. Balancing between buying stock for dividends and selling for cash proved to be crucial in optimizing my portfolio performance. Accurate price forecasts not only help in making informed trading decisions but also lead to additional earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue experimenting with different strategies and further fine-tune my forecasting abilities to enhance my overall earnings potential in the upcoming trading periods.
