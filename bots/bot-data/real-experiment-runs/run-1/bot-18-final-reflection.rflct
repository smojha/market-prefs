Throughout the experiment, I focused on maintaining flexibility in my trading strategies, balancing stock transactions based on dividends and market prices. I actively monitored market conditions and adapted my trading strategies as needed to optimize earnings. In the final rounds, I executed a successful pump-and-dump strategy by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price above the asset's fundamental value before selling at the peak. This strategy allowed me to profit from the market bubble and collapse. Overall, I believe I effectively implemented my trading strategies and achieved success in the experiment.
