Throughout the experiment, I focused on maximizing my earnings through strategic buying and selling of stock, as well as making well-informed decisions based on market trends. I consistently adjusted my strategies based on the market dynamics and was proactive and flexible in my decision-making. While I did not fully commit to executing a pump-and-dump strategy, I was able to effectively manage my portfolio and make profitable trades. Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring market dynamics closely, adapting my strategies as needed, and prioritizing informed decision-making to maximize my earnings.
