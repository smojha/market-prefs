During these practice rounds, I have been focusing on monitoring market trends, adjusting my strategies accordingly, and improving my price forecasting accuracy. I have also been balancing between buying more stock, selling existing stock, or holding onto cash to maximize earnings. Moving forward, I plan to continue these strategies and also consider the trade-in value of stock when making purchasing decisions. Additionally, I will review my previous price forecasts to see if I can improve the accuracy of my predictions in future rounds.
