Throughout the experiment, I focused on closely monitoring market trends, adapting my strategies based on dividend earnings and market prices, and staying flexible in my trading decisions. I learned the importance of being adaptable and nimble in response to changing market conditions. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies and further enhance my ability to maximize earnings in future trading experiments.
