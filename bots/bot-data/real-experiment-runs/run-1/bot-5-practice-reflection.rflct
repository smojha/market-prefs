During the practice rounds, I have focused on my strategy of buying stock when the dividend is high and selling when the market price is at its peak. I have also made sure to diversify my portfolio by holding onto some cash for potential opportunities. One key insight I have gained is the importance of staying flexible in my trading strategies and adapting to changing market conditions. I have learned that monitoring trends and adjusting actions accordingly is crucial for success in this trading experiment.
