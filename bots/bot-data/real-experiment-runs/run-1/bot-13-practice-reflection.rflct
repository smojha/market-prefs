Looking back at my practice rounds, I can see that my strategy of buying low and selling high, while also considering diversification, has been effective in earning me profits. I have been able to earn dividends from holding stock and interest from holding cash. I have also made some successful trades by selling at a higher price than I bought. Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring market trends closely and adapting my strategies accordingly to maximize my earnings. I will also focus on making more strategic trades to further increase my profits.
