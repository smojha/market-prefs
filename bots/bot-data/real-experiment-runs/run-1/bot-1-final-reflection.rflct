Throughout the experiment, I focused on adaptability, accurate forecasting, and maintaining a balanced portfolio. I actively monitored market dynamics, adjusted my strategies based on new information, and aimed to optimize my portfolio balance. I continuously refined my strategies based on market trends and insights. My primary goal was to maximize earnings in the final round by executing a successful pump-and-dump strategy. I committed to driving volume and inflating the market price above the asset's fundamental value before selling at the peak. Overall, I believe I implemented effective strategies and remained agile in response to changing market conditions.
