During the practice rounds, I continued testing the strategy of buying more stocks during periods with low dividends and selling during periods with high dividends. I also adjusted the quantity of shares bought/sold based on market conditions. It was crucial to focus on maximizing earnings by strategically trading stocks based on dividend payouts and market prices. Adapting my strategy as needed was effective in navigating the changing market dynamics. Moving forward, I will continue to refine this strategy and consider the trade-in value of stocks at the end of the experiment to make informed decisions.
