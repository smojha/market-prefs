Based on the practice rounds so far, I can see that my strategy of buying additional stock when the market price is low and selling when it's high has been somewhat effective. I will continue to focus on this strategy during the main experiment, with the goal of maximizing my total earnings. Additionally, I will make sure to spend more time accurately forecasting prices in order to earn rewards. I will also keep a close eye on balancing my cash and stock holdings effectively to optimize my earnings. Overall, I feel confident in my current approach and look forward to applying it in the upcoming trading periods.
