I have prioritized maximizing earnings in each round, which has helped me accumulate a significant amount of cash and stock. Reflecting on my performance, I see the value in staying adaptable and making data-driven decisions. Moving forward, I will continue refining my strategies based on available information to ensure optimal decision-making in future trading scenarios.
