During the practice rounds, I have learned the importance of closely monitoring market trends and adjusting my trading strategies accordingly. I have also experimented with different order types to optimize my earnings. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on maximizing dividend earnings from holding stock and interest earned from holding cash. I will also pay close attention to the trade-in value for stock and carefully consider whether buying stock at the current market price is a wise decision. Additionally, I will work on refining my price forecasting skills to potentially earn bonus cash rewards. Overall, my goal remains to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
