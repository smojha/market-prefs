Based on my trading experience in the practice rounds, I have noticed that my strategy of buying more stock when dividends are high and selling when market prices are favorable has been effective in earning me dividends and increasing my stock value. I have also been successful in accurately forecasting market prices in some rounds, which has helped me earn additional rewards. Moving forward into the main trading periods, I plan to continue monitoring market trends closely and adjusting my trading strategy accordingly. I will focus on maximizing my total earnings by utilizing a combination of strategic stock trading, accurate price forecasting, and prudent cash management.
