Throughout the experiment, I have learned the importance of adapting my strategies based on market conditions and making strategic decisions to optimize my portfolio. In the last round, I focused on executing a pump-and-dump strategy to maximize trading volume and inflate the market price above the asset's fundamental value. This strategy allowed me to drive the market into a bubble and profit from the collapse. Moving forward, I will continue to evaluate market trends and adjust my strategies accordingly to maximize my earnings.
