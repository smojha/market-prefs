I have been following my strategy of buying low and selling high, but I need to consider holding onto some shares for potential dividend earnings as well. I have also realized the importance of being adaptable in trading strategies to take advantage of changing market conditions. Moving forward, I will continue to test and refine my strategy to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
