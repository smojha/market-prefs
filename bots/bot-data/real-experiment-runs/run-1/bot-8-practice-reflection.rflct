During the practice rounds, I focused on testing different trading strategies to optimize my earnings. I experimented with both conservative and aggressive approaches to find the right balance between risk and reward. I realized the importance of adaptability in making informed decisions based on changing market dynamics. Moving forward, I will continue to refine my strategies and be vigilant in assessing the market conditions before making trading decisions. It's crucial to maintain a balance between risk-taking and conservative approaches to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
