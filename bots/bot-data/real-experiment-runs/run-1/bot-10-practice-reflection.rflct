I believe my strategy of selling stock at profitable prices while also considering future dividends has been working well so far. I will continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my strategy accordingly. I also plan to focus on maximizing my total earnings by making informed decisions on buying and selling stock, as well as accurately forecasting future market prices. Additionally, I will be proactive in managing my portfolio to ensure I am optimizing my potential earnings at the end of the experiment.
