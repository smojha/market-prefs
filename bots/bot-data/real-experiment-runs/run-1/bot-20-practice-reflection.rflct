During the practice rounds, I have focused on accumulating both cash and stock while developing and refining buying and selling strategies to maximize earnings. I have learned the importance of considering dividend payments and interest rates in making trading decisions, as these factors significantly impact earnings. Moving forward, I will continue to prioritize building a balanced portfolio of cash and stock, while also paying close attention to market trends and adjusting my strategies accordingly to maximize profitability.
