After reviewing my past strategies and insights, I have realized the importance of closely monitoring market price trends and adjusting my strategies accordingly. I have also acknowledged the potential benefits of implementing a stop-loss strategy to minimize losses. Moving forward, I plan to continue testing the strategy of buying more stock when the dividend yield is high and selling stock when the market price is higher than the buyback price. Additionally, I will consider incorporating a stop-loss strategy into my trading approach to manage potential risks effectively.
