Throughout the experiment, I focused on adjusting my portfolio strategically to maximize earnings. I consistently leveraged dividend earnings and interest payments to enhance my overall return. In the later rounds, I maintained a balanced approach of buying and selling shares to optimize my cash position. I also paid close attention to market conditions and adjusted my strategies accordingly. Overall, I believe I executed my pump-and-dump strategy effectively by maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price before selling at the peak.
