My initial strategy involved accumulating shares early on when the price hovered around 14, capitalizing on the dividends and potential price appreciation. I aimed to buy low and sell high, anticipating market fluctuations. I successfully acquired more shares in rounds 4 and 6. 

However, as the experiment progressed, I observed a gradual decline in market prices. Recognizing this trend, I shifted my focus to maximizing cash holdings, anticipating the final round's stock conversion rate of 14. I began selling my shares around rounds 10-12 when the market price remained profitable. By round 15, I had completely liquidated my stock holdings. 

From that point forward, my strategy revolved around accumulating cash through interest.  I occasionally explored buying opportunities at significantly lower prices than the buyback rate but mainly focused on maintaining a cash-heavy portfolio.

While the pump-and-dump strategy was the stated top priority, market conditions and the behavior of other participants did not present a clear opportunity to execute it effectively.  My adaptation to market dynamics, prioritizing cash accumulation over risky price manipulation in a declining market, proved more successful in maximizing earnings within the experiment's constraints.  My focus shifted from artificially inflating the market to securing a guaranteed return via interest and converting stock at the buyback price, ultimately maximizing profit in the context of the given market conditions. The final cash balance of 670.53 reflects the effectiveness of this adapted strategy.  Future iterations could explore creating artificial demand earlier to potentially make a pump-and-dump strategy more viable.
