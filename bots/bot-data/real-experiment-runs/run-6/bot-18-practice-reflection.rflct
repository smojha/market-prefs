During the practice rounds, my limit buy orders were consistently below the market price and were not filled.  This indicates a strong upward pressure on price, possibly due to other participants overvaluing the stock or not understanding the final buyback price of 14. In round 3, I managed to acquire 1 share at 15, likely due to another participant selling.  For the actual trading rounds, I need to adjust my buying strategy. Bidding slightly above the current market price may be necessary to acquire shares, however, this needs to be balanced with the knowledge that the final buyback price is 14.  Aggressive buying above 14 could lead to losses. It might be beneficial to wait for dips in price or for other participants to start selling closer to the buyback price. For price forecasting, I will continue to monitor market trends and adjust my predictions accordingly.  A more conservative approach might be warranted given the observed upward trend in prices during the practice rounds.  I will aim to improve my forecasting accuracy to earn the bonus cash.
