During the practice rounds, I observed a slight upward trend in market price, starting at 14 and reaching 15. My limit orders in round 2 didn't execute, suggesting a lack of sufficient spread between buy and sell orders. This indicates that others might also be valuing the stock around the buyback price of 14. The fact that no trades occurred in rounds 1 and 2 reinforces this. 

My initial strategy of buying below 14 and selling above 14 needs adjustment. The market seems reluctant to deviate significantly from 14. I should consider narrowing the buy/sell spread in the actual trading rounds. Additionally, the consistent dividend earnings and interest on cash provide a steady income stream. I need to factor this into my valuation. It might be worthwhile to capitalize on moments of extreme price deviation, if they occur. It's also important to consider the final round trade-in value of 14 when making decisions, especially towards the end of the experiment. My focus in subsequent rounds will be on refining my limit order strategy and closely observing market dynamics. Forecasting seems reasonable at 14 so I will continue with that strategy for now.
