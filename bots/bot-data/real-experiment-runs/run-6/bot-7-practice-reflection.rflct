During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price hovering around 14-15. My limit orders to buy at 12 and sell at 16 were not filled, suggesting a narrow spread and potentially a lack of aggressive trading among participants.  Since the final buyback price is 14, buying above this price carries risk. In the actual trading rounds, I will need to be more responsive to market fluctuations. I should consider narrower spreads on my limit orders to increase the likelihood of execution. I also need to start formulating a more concrete strategy for later rounds as the price approaches the buyback price to avoid being stuck with overpriced shares.
