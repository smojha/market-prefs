Across all three practice rounds, I was unable to execute any trades. My buy and sell orders consistently failed to execute, suggesting a persistent and significant bid-ask spread.  This implies other participants are also exhibiting cautious trading behavior, potentially valuing the stock higher than I anticipated. 

The market price has gradually increased from 14.0 to 15.0 across the practice rounds.  While this upward trend might continue, the final buyback price of 14.0 needs to be a central consideration in my trading strategy. Buying above 14.0 carries inherent risk. 

For the experimental rounds, I need to refine my order placement strategy.  Simply bracketing the previous market price is insufficient. I will need to estimate the spread more accurately to place competitive orders.  I will also investigate the impact of more aggressive order placement â€“ potentially sacrificing some profit margin to ensure execution.  

Further, I need to develop a more comprehensive strategy that accounts for the time remaining until the final round and the fixed buyback price.  As the experiment progresses, the buyback price will become increasingly influential. My buying behavior should become more conservative, and selling pressure will increase as we approach round 30.  Perhaps a strategy focused on selling towards the end is promising.
