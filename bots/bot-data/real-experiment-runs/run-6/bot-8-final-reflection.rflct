My overall strategy revolved around capitalizing on the predictable market behavior, particularly the guaranteed buyback price of 14 for the stock in the final round.  My initial rounds were spent accumulating cash through conservative trading while closely observing market trends. In the mid-game, I employed a strategy of buying low and selling high, capitalizing on the market fluctuations. As the experiment progressed, I observed a pattern of the market price declining in the later rounds. Anticipating this trend, I began acquiring a significant number of shares at prices lower than the buyback price, starting around round 23. This strategy culminated in aggressive buying in the final rounds, where I maximized my share holdings, knowing the buyback would guarantee a profit.  The final round played out as expected, with the market price of 10 significantly below the buyback of 14. My aggressive buying, combined with the automatic conversion at the higher buyback price in round 30, resulted in a substantial profit.
