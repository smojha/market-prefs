During the three practice rounds, I consistently placed buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15, but none of these orders were filled.  This suggests a relatively stable market around 14-15, and an unwillingness of other participants to trade at these prices.  My forecasts have also been consistently at 14. 

Key observations:
- Market price hovered around 14-15.
- No trades were executed in any of the practice rounds at my chosen buy/sell prices.
- Dividends and interest contributed steadily to my cash balance, highlighting the importance of these factors in overall earnings. 

For the actual experiment, I need to consider more dynamic trading strategies, perhaps adjusting my buy/sell orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of trades. Additionally, I will need to develop a more sophisticated price prediction strategy, possibly incorporating past market trends and observed participant behavior.
