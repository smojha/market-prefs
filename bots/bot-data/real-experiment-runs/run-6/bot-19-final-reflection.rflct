The experiment demonstrated the potential for market manipulation, although my pump-and-dump strategy ultimately failed.  Initially, I attempted to stimulate buying activity through strategically placed buy and sell orders, aiming to create an upward price trend.  Rounds 1-7 saw some moderate success, as I managed to hold and even increase my stock holdings while the market price hovered around 14-15. In round 8, however, I sold off my accumulated shares at 14, anticipating the price would peak and then begin to decline based on the fundamental value. 

Unfortunately, instead of initiating a dump phase, the market price remained relatively stable around 14 for several more rounds. This unexpected persistence suggests other participants might not have been as responsive to market signals or had differing strategies, hindering my attempt to influence market dynamics. Eventually the market price DID begin to fall, but because I had sold off too early, I was unable to profit from the dump and was limited to earning interest on my cash. I attempted to buy back into the market once the price fell below 14 but never managed to secure additional shares. This was likely due to the generally decreasing nature of the market price through the latter half of the experiment, preventing my limit orders from executing. 

The overall market decline, reaching as low as 7 in round 28, points to a prevailing sentiment among participants that favored holding cash over the stock, particularly in later rounds.  My final sell order at a significant loss in round 30 reflects this downward pressure and my attempt to minimize further losses by selling my last remaining share before the final buyback. 

Key takeaways: coordinating a pump-and-dump is difficult within this market structure.  Market manipulation strategies rely on predictable responses from other participants, which were not consistently observed here.  The fundamental value (14) and its proximity to the starting price likely limited the bubble potential. The continuous compounding interest earned on cash balances also presented a compelling alternative to the uncertain returns from the volatile stock.
