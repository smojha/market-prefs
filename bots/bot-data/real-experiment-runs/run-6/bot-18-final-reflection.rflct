My overall strategy was initially focused on accumulating stock, anticipating price increases. However, as the experiment progressed, I observed the inherent volatility of the market and the fixed buyback price of 14.  Recognizing the potential for losses if holding stock beyond a certain point, I shifted my strategy to maximize cash holdings by strategically selling off my stock.  The final rounds saw me prioritize cash accumulation to capitalize on the guaranteed 5% interest and avoid the risk of holding stock that could be bought back at a lower price than the market value. This strategy proved effective, as evidenced by my final cash balance and overall earnings. While I did explore buying low and selling high, I observed that the market price tended to fluctuate around 14, making consistent profits through trading challenging.  A key learning was the importance of adapting to market dynamics and recognizing the limitations imposed by the fixed buyback price in the later rounds.  Focusing on maximizing cash in the final rounds proved to be the most reliable path to profit maximization in this experiment.
