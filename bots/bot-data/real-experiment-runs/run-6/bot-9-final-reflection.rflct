My initial strategy involved submitting limit buy and sell orders slightly above and below the previous market price to capitalize on fluctuations and potentially acquire shares at a favorable price.  I aimed to increase my share holdings initially, anticipating price appreciation driven by dividends and market dynamics. 

As the experiment progressed and the final round approached, my focus shifted towards maximizing cash holdings.  I began selling off my shares to avoid the risk of the final round liquidation at 14, which consistently proved lower than market prices during the mid-game. 

While attempting to execute the pump and dump strategy, my initial efforts to increase market volume and inflate prices did not significantly influence the overall market trend.  The inherent difficulty in executing pump-and-dump schemes within this experimental framework is likely due to the other participants in the market seeking to maximize their own profits, and therefore undercutting efforts to artificially inflate the market price. The fixed buyback value at the end of the experiment provided a clear upper limit to the perceived fundamental value, creating a constant downward pressure on the market price in later rounds, and mitigating the potential for sustained bubbles.
