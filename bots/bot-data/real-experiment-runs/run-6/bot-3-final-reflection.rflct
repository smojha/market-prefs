The experiment concluded with all stock liquidated and a final cash position of 597.84.  While I attempted to influence the market through strategic buy and sell orders, my impact on overall market dynamics appears to have been limited. My individual trades didn't create substantial price volatility or sustained upward trends.  

The initial rounds focused on understanding market behavior and establishing a baseline.  In the middle rounds, I attempted to exploit predictable fluctuations by buying low and selling high. However, market sentiment proved difficult to predict and manipulate. As the experiment progressed, it became clear that other participants were also pursuing diverse strategies. In the later rounds,  I shifted focus to mitigating the fixed buyback price risk in round 30 by liquidating all stock holdings before the final round. This proved successful.

Overall,  while I was not able to implement a large-scale pump-and-dump scheme, the strategy of liquidating stock before round 30 was successful. Future experiments might focus on earlier and more aggressive market manipulation tactics, or attempts to coordinate strategies with other players to exert more influence. Deeper analysis of the other players' behavior might allow more insight into their strategies and decision-making processes to inform future manipulative trading strategies.
