During the practice rounds, I observed the market price fluctuating slightly around 14-15. I maintained my initial holdings of 4 stocks and accumulated cash through dividends and interest.  I did not submit any orders to buy or sell stock.  My current strategy for the main experiment is to buy stock if the price falls below 14, the buyback price, and sell if it rises significantly above 14.  I will continue to observe market trends and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I will also aim to improve the accuracy of my price forecasts, as these offer a significant potential for bonus cash earnings.
