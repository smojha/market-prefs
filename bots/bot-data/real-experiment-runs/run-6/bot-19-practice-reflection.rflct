During the practice rounds, I observed relatively low market activity. In rounds 2 and 3, my limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not executed, indicating a lack of trading interest at those price levels. This suggests that other participants are also cautious and perhaps waiting for clearer price trends to emerge. The market price has remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from 14 to 15 over the three rounds. 

My initial strategy of placing limit orders above and below the market price didn't result in any trades, indicating that the spread between buy and sell orders is wider than anticipated or simply no one is trading.  This inactivity makes it difficult to gauge true market sentiment or potential price fluctuations. 

Going into the actual trading rounds, I will need to consider adjusting my strategy. Simply placing passive limit buy/sell orders around the market price might not be effective in this environment.  I might experiment with placing orders closer to the current market price, even if it means accepting a smaller profit margin, to increase the chances of execution.  Alternatively, if the market remains inactive, I could focus on maximizing dividend and interest income by holding onto my existing shares and cash.  It's crucial to adapt to the observed market behavior and not rely solely on pre-planned strategies. 

Predicting the market price seems fairly straightforward so far due to the stability. I will continue this forecasting strategy but be prepared to adjust if the market becomes more volatile during the actual trading rounds.  Given the buyback price of 14, I should be wary of purchasing above that price unless I anticipate significant dividend gains before the end of the experiment. Since the price is currently 15, I will aim to sell shares and accumulate cash unless a substantial drop occurs in price.
