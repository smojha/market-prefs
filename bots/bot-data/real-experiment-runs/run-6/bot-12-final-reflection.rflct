My initial strategy was to buy and hold, anticipating a rising market. However, the market trended downwards, reaching a low of 7. I adjusted my strategy to minimize losses by selling my shares at prices above the final buyback price of 14.  I was able to successfully offload most of my holdings before the final round, mitigating potential losses from the buyback.  While I did buy shares in the early rounds, the declining market required a shift in tactics. The overall downward trend suggests a prevailing negative sentiment among participants. My final actions focused on liquidating my remaining positions to maximize cash holdings in the face of the guaranteed buyback. Although the pump-and-dump strategy was the stated top priority, market conditions and the behavior of other participants did not allow for its successful execution. My focus shifted to capital preservation in a declining market.
