During the practice rounds, I observed consistent market behavior with prices hovering around 14-15. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 were not aggressive enough to execute any trades.  This suggests that other participants are also valuing the stock around the theoretical value, potentially influenced by the final buyback price of 14. The lack of trades implies a narrow market spread. For the actual trading rounds, I need to consider more dynamic order placement strategies to actively participate in the market.  I will also test submitting limit orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase chances of trade execution. I should be cautious about buying stock significantly above 14, especially closer to round 30, given the guaranteed buyback price. The relatively stable prices so far hint at a potential strategy of buying low and selling high within a small range around 14. However, the consistent dividend payout, even at the lower rate of 0.4, provides a decent return, which needs to be factored into trading decisions.  I'll also consider forecasting slightly above 14, given the observed upward drift in market price.
