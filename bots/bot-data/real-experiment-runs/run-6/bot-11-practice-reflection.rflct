During the practice rounds, I observed that my limit buy orders were not filled when placed significantly below the market price. This suggests that other participants were not willing to sell at those lower prices.  It also suggests that predicting market price accurately is crucial for successful trading. 

In round 2, I experimented with a limit sell order slightly above the market price, but it was not executed. This indicates that setting competitive buy/sell prices is essential for order fulfillment.

My initial strategy of placing limit buy orders below market price and sell orders above was not effective in the first two rounds. In round 3, selling one share at market price of 15 was a good decision as it's higher than the final buyback price of 14.  I will likely need to revise this approach for the actual trading rounds by placing orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase the chance of execution, even if that means slightly overpaying or underselling. 

I will continue to refine my price forecasting strategy by studying past market behavior and dividend payouts.  The current forecast may be overly static. Consideration of dividend payouts in addition to final buyback value will be key for profit maximization.
