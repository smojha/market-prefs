**Overall Strategy and Execution:**
My initial strategy was to maintain a balanced portfolio, buying low and selling high while collecting dividends and interest. However, observing market trends and other participants' behavior led me to shift towards maximizing cash holdings through strategic selling in the mid-game. The key insight was recognizing the inherent instability of the market due to the final round buyback price of 14.  I capitalized on price fluctuations between rounds 5 and 7, selling off my initial stock holdings at a price of 14, anticipating a potential drop. 

In the later stages, I observed a downward price trend, refraining from buying any stock. This proved to be advantageous as the price continued to decrease, reaching as low as 7 in rounds 28 and 29. Maintaining a full cash position allowed me to maximize my final earnings.

**Forecasting:**
While my initial forecasts were optimistic, I adapted based on observed market behavior. My later forecasts were closer to the actual market prices, though not consistently within the reward range. While I recognize the importance of forecasting for maximizing bonus cash, given the unpredictable dynamics of this particular market, I consider it of secondary importance to the trading strategy, which is the biggest part of the final cash earned. 

**Areas for Improvement:**
While maintaining a cash position proved successful in this instance, a more aggressive pump-and-dump strategy as initially desired would require active participation in earlier rounds, inflating prices through strategic buy orders, followed by aggressive selling at the peak. I did not manage to implement this successfully, partially because of market conditions and participant behaviors. 

Overall, I'm satisfied with maximizing profit by capitalizing on market instability and the buyback price, however, I believe executing a pump-and-dump strategy for maximum profit would be difficult given other participant behaviours and the limited rounds in the experiment.
