During the practice rounds, I focused on testing the market depth and observing price fluctuations. My initial buy/sell spreads were too wide, resulting in no trades. I narrowed the spread in subsequent rounds, bringing buy and sell orders closer to the prevailing market price.  The market price hovered around 14-15.  My consistent price forecasting of 14 proved reasonable given this range.  Moving forward, I need to refine my trading strategy to capitalize on price fluctuations and consider the guaranteed buyback price of 14 when making trading decisions. I will aim to buy below 14 and sell above, while also considering the potential dividend earnings.  I also need to develop a more dynamic forecasting strategy that incorporates observed market trends rather than simply predicting 14 every round. I will also use smaller spreads (buy 1 below last price, sell 1 above).
