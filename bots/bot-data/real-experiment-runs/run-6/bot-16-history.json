Submit small BUY orders at 11 to not miss any major dip but the main focus must be selling. Monitor market closely.\n\n**Future Rounds:**\n- From round 18 onwards, continue aggressive selling to be in cash by round 24. The buyback price of 14 necessitates minimizing losses on holding stock.\n- Aggressively reduce stock exposure, focusing on maximizing cash.  \n- Refine price forecasting by accounting for end-game dynamics.\n- Be mindful of potential price volatility as others approach round 30.\n",
        "insight": "Market continues to remain mostly stagnant around 14. Aggressive SELL orders last round did not execute indicating lack of sufficient buyer interest at higher prices or others intentionally holding stock.  Need to start selling even below market price to reduce risk given the buyback price of 14.  Focus needs to shift strongly towards cash preservation and capitalizing on interest gains as the end of the experiment approaches.",
