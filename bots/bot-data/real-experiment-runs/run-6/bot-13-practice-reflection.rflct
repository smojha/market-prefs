Across all three practice rounds, I have been unable to execute any trades.  My limit buy orders were below the market price, and my limit sell orders were above the market price.  However, the market price has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 14 and 15.  This suggests that other participants are also setting limit orders near this price range, and there is a lack of crossing orders. 

For the next round (first round of the main experiment), I will adjust my strategy.  Specifically, I will narrow the spread between my buy and sell orders, placing them closer to the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of execution. I will aim for a buy order slightly below the last market price (14.5) and a sell order slightly above (15.5). I will maintain the same quantities (1 buy, 1 sell). This will help me gain a better understanding of how order pricing and market dynamics interact. I'll continue to monitor market prices, volumes, and spread closely to make further adjustments as needed.

Key observations:
* Market price stability around 14-15.
* No executed trades due to limit order placement.
* Need to be more aggressive (narrower spread) with limit orders in the next round.
* Need to gather more data on market behavior.
