Across the three practice rounds, no trades were executed due to persistent wide bid-ask spreads.  My initial strategy of setting buy orders below and sell orders above the previous market price proved ineffective in eliciting trades. The market price has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around the buyback price of 14. Dividends and interest income contributed to increased cash holdings.  For the experimental rounds, I will further narrow the bid-ask spread and explore more aggressive order placement to test market responsiveness. I also plan to incorporate the buyback price of 14 more directly into my trading strategy, potentially aiming to buy below and sell above this threshold.  Additionally, I will refine my forecasting strategy based on the observed price stability, potentially predicting values closer to 14 and adjusting based on emerging trends in the real rounds.
