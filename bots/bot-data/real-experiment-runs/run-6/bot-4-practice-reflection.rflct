During the practice rounds, I focused on testing the boundaries of the market by placing limit orders slightly above and below the prevailing market price. As anticipated, none of these orders were executed.  This confirms my initial insight that the market is relatively efficient, with participants valuing the stock close to its fundamental value, which seems to be influenced by the dividend payouts and the final buyback price of 14.  The lack of trading volume further supports this observation. Moving forward, I plan to refine my strategy for the actual game rounds by incorporating the buyback price more explicitly.  Specifically, I will avoid buying stock significantly above 14 and prioritize selling if the market price goes substantially above this threshold, especially as we get closer to round 30. I will also consider incorporating the dividend payout uncertainty and the 5% interest earned on cash into my valuation model. The 5% interest could make holding cash more attractive.
