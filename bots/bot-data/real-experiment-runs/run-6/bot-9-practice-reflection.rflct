During the three practice rounds, I consistently placed limit buy orders below and limit sell orders above the prevailing market price. However, none of these orders were filled, suggesting a lack of sufficient spread between buy and sell orders within the market.  This implies other participants may be employing similar strategies.  The market price has shown a slight upward trend, increasing from 14.0 to 14.5 and then to 15.0. My current cash balance is 125.73, and I hold 4 shares.  Given the final trade-in value of 14.0 per share, I need to refine my strategy for the actual trading rounds to achieve profitable trades.  In the upcoming rounds, I will experiment with more aggressive limit order placement, narrowing the gap between my buy and sell prices to increase the likelihood of order execution. Additionally, I will consider adjusting the quantities of shares in my orders based on observed market volatility and price trends. I will also consider the implications of the fixed buyback price of 14 when making trading decisions as the experiment progresses.
