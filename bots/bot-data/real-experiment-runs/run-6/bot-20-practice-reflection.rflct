During the three practice rounds, I consistently placed limit buy orders below and sell orders above the previous market price (13 and 15 respectively). However, none of these orders were filled, indicating a lack of sufficient market activity within this price range. The market price gradually increased from 14 to 14.5 and finally 15, suggesting potential upward pressure, or possibly just random fluctuation in a thin market. My current cash holding is 125.73 and I own 4 shares of stock.  It's worth noting that the final stock value is fixed at 14, so purchasing above this price carries risk unless I anticipate being able to sell at a higher price in later rounds. Since trading volume has been zero, focusing solely on value investing at this point seems reasonable, meaning no purchasing above 14, and selling when there is demand above 14.
