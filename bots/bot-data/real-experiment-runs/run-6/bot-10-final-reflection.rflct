My initial strategy involved establishing a consistent baseline price forecast and maintaining a neutral trading stance, aiming to observe market dynamics and identify opportunities. During the middle rounds, I experimented with actively influencing the market by placing buy orders above the prevailing market price, intending to drive up prices and increase my stock holdings. This strategy was somewhat successful in increasing volume in certain rounds, although it did not significantly impact the overall price trend. However, as the experiment progressed, the market exhibited a clear downward trend towards the final rounds. Recognizing the impending buyback at 14, I adjusted my strategy to focus on liquidating my stock holdings before the final round, contributing to the market's decline.  Ultimately, I sold my remaining shares near the end and finished with a predominantly cash position. While my attempts to inflate the market for a classic "pump and dump" were met with limited success, I was able to capitalize on the downward trend. Further analysis of market participant behavior and forecasting accuracy could provide valuable insights for refining manipulative strategies in future experiments.
