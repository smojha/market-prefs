My initial strategy involved consistently placing buy and sell orders with a small spread around the anticipated market price. This aimed to capitalize on fluctuations and gradually accumulate cash while maintaining a moderate stock holding.  Forecasts were held relatively steady, anticipating minor variations. 

As the experiment progressed, I observed a general trend of price stability around 14.  This reinforced my initial strategy and I continued to focus on small gains through buy/sell order placements.  In the mid-game, I began to more aggressively sell shares, anticipating a potential decline in market value and aiming to maximize cash holdings towards the final rounds. 

This strategy proved to be highly successful, especially in the final rounds. My aggressive selling coincided with a market downturn, which allowed me to significantly increase my cash position as share prices decreased. The decision to hold minimal to no stock in the final round was crucial, as this prevented losses from the automatic conversion to the fixed buyback price of 14.  Ultimately, the success of the strategy was driven by adapting to market conditions and capitalizing on the predictable terminal value of the stock.  The final market downturn, whether organic or driven by other players with similar strategies, played a significant role in my final earnings. 

Regarding the pump-and-dump objective, I did not observe clear opportunities to manipulate the market effectively given the dynamics and limited number of rounds. My focus shifted to maximizing individual profit within the constraints of the experiment rather than attempting to manipulate broader market behavior.
