The experiment concluded with a successful execution of the final round strategy.  Market dynamics in the later rounds heavily favored cash positions, driving prices down. This presented an opportunity to maximize cash holdings. I focused on selling shares when possible, capitalizing on brief price increases, while resisting the urge to buy at inflated prices. The final round sale at 10.0 further solidified the cash advantage.  Although the pump-and-dump strategy was not feasible in this market environment, maximizing cash before the terminal round proved to be the most effective approach.
