During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the fundamental value of 14. My limit orders in round 2 were not executed, likely due to a wide bid-ask spread.  This suggests that other participants may also be anchoring around the fundamental value and unwilling to deviate significantly. 

My initial strategy of buying low and selling high was not successful in the practice rounds due to the lack of favorable market conditions and potentially due to a wide spread. It may be beneficial to be more aggressive with pricing to secure trades in the actual experiment rounds. For example, I could try submitting limit buy orders closer to or even slightly above 14, and limit sell orders closer to or slightly below 14.

For the main experiment, I will need to closely monitor market trends and adapt my strategy as more data becomes available. Gathering more data on price fluctuations and trading volumes during the initial rounds is crucial to refine my approach. I should also consider diversifying and holding a combination of cash and stock to balance potential returns from dividends and interest. It seems others may be playing conservatively, possibly focusing on the fundamental value. I'll explore taking advantage of this in the actual experiment.
