During the practice rounds, I consistently attempted to buy at 13 and sell at 15. However, none of these orders were filled. This suggests that other participants are also employing a similar strategy, or the market has not reached these price points.  The market price started at 14, then increased to 14.5 and 15.  It's currently above the buyback price of 14. 

Key observation: My limit orders are not aggressive enough to be executed in the current market conditions.  I need to consider narrowing the gap between my buy and sell prices and potentially submitting orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase the chances of fills. Also, the upward trend in market price warrants further investigation. I will continue monitoring the market for more discernible trends and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next rounds. The fact that the price is currently above the buyback price suggests there's potential to profit by selling, but buying at this stage may be risky if the price drops closer to the buyback amount.
