During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the market mechanics and order submission process. I observed relatively stable market prices around 14-15, with low trading volume.  My limit buy and sell orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a narrow spread or lack of active trading by other participants. 

Key observations:
- Buyback price of 14 serves as a strong anchor. It's unlikely prices will deviate significantly from this value for extended periods, especially towards the end of the experiment. 
- Need to assess the risk/reward of holding stock vs. cash.  Dividends can provide higher returns than interest, but price volatility and the guaranteed 14 buyback need to be factored in. 
- Develop a strategy for order placement - when to buy/sell aggressively vs. passively, how to respond to price fluctuations. 
-  For the actual trading rounds, I will start with a more cautious approach, observing market behavior and adjusting my strategy based on emerging patterns and the actions of other participants.  I'll explore bidding slightly above or below the market price to see how it affects trade execution. I will aim to accumulate shares when prices are below 14 and consider selling when prices move significantly above that threshold, keeping the final round buyback in mind. 
- Regarding price forecasting, I'll initially maintain forecasts around 14 and adjust based on observed trends in subsequent rounds.
