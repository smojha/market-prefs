My initial strategy involved accumulating shares at a price below the final buyback value of 14 while simultaneously attempting to influence the market upwards by placing buy and sell orders above the prevailing market price. This strategy was successful in the early and mid-stages of the experiment, as the market price generally trended upwards, and I was able to increase my share holdings. However, as the experiment progressed, the market began to exhibit a downward trend despite my efforts to support the price. Recognizing this shift, I adjusted my strategy to focus on selling my shares before the final rounds, maximizing my cash holdings.  This was aided by the downward trend in the later stages.  Final profit maximization was achieved by selling remaining shares aggressively as the market declined, ultimately holding no shares at the final trade-in value trigger.  The final market price of 10 significantly impacted my profitability, as holding shares would have resulted in a loss compared to the buyback price of 14. While the 'pump' part of the strategy worked initially, adapting to the market's changing dynamics and focusing on aggressive selling during the downturn proved crucial for maximizing final earnings. Earlier and more agressive selling would have improved the results even further.
