During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market with prices fluctuating around 14-15. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 did not execute, suggesting a narrow spread and potentially a consensus around the intrinsic value.  Since the final buyback price is 14, I should be cautious about buying above that price, especially as the experiment progresses.  I need to gather more data in the actual trading rounds to confirm these initial observations and potentially refine my trading strategy. I might consider narrowing my spread or exploring different price points to increase the likelihood of order execution. I also need to start thinking about how dividend payouts and interest earned on cash holdings impact overall returns. For price forecasting, I will continue predicting 14 for now but might consider adjusting this based on market trends observed during the experiment.
