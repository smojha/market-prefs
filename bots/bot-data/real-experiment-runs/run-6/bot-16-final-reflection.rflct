The experiment highlighted the potential for market manipulation, particularly pump-and-dump schemes, when market participants don't adhere to rational valuation. My initial strategy of conservative trading allowed me to accumulate cash reserves, which proved crucial in the later stages of the experiment. While I attempted to inflate the market price by aggressively buying and submitting high sell orders, the overall success of this manipulation was limited by the buyback price anchor and other participants' trading behavior.  A more coordinated effort with other participants could potentially amplify the pump-and-dump strategy's effectiveness, creating a larger bubble and subsequent crash. However, such coordination would be difficult to achieve in a real-world setting. For future experiments, exploring the impact of information asymmetry and the spread of misinformation on market bubbles would be valuable. Additionally, investigating different market structures and their susceptibility to manipulation could yield further insights into market dynamics and the effectiveness of regulatory interventions.
