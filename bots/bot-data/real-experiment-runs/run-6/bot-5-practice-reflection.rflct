During the practice rounds, I observed a consistent upward trend in the market price, starting at 14 and reaching 15. Despite placing limit buy orders below the buyback price and sell orders above it, none of my orders were executed. This suggests a potential bullish sentiment among other participants, valuing the stock above its guaranteed final value. 

My initial strategy of bracketing the buyback price with buy and sell orders proved ineffective in these initial rounds. For the main experiment, I will explore strategies that take into account the potential for continued price increases, perhaps by focusing more on identifying a reasonable upper bound for buy orders based on short-term expected dividend earnings. I will also consider placing sell orders further above the buyback price to capitalize on potential overvaluation by other players, and aim to accumulate cash reserves during rounds where prices are high. Additionally, forecasting the price requires more sophisticated techniques rather than simply using 14. A potential approach is to factor in previous round prices and observe the trend to forecast future prices.
