My initial strategy involved submitting buy and sell orders slightly above and below the previous market price to capitalize on small fluctuations and accumulate cash through interest and dividends.  This approach proved effective for several rounds, allowing me to increase my cash holdings significantly. 

However, I noticed a consistent pattern of the market price hovering around 14.  This stability indicated a possible equilibrium point, potentially influenced by other participants' similar strategies or a general understanding of the stock's inherent value (buyback price of 14).  This prompted me to buy one additional share at the market price of 14 in round 10, as the price was consistently at/around that point. 

As the experiment progressed, I observed the market price declining beyond the initial stable point.  Recognizing the inherent risk in holding stocks as the final rounds approached and the buyback price was revealed to be 14, I shifted my focus to selling my stock holdings.  This led to selling all my shares at 14. 

In the later rounds, the market continued to decline. While my earlier sales were fortuitous, missing the opportunity to capitalize on the higher prices in the early rounds limited my overall profit.  I also did not fully capitalize on opportunities to exploit market fluctuations.  

The end-of-experiment value significantly dropped due to late sell-offs by other players. My more cautious approach in the final rounds prevented heavier losses.  If participating in a similar experiment, I would prioritize maximizing early gains while remaining vigilant for market shifts and adjusting strategy accordingly.
