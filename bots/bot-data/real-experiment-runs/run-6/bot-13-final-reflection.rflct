My initial strategy was to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the dividend and interest income.  However, the market trended downwards throughout the experiment. I observed that other participants were likely influenced by similar strategies or reacting to market fluctuations without a clear fundamental understanding of the stock's intrinsic value (14).  

My attempts to influence the market upwards with strategic buys and sells were unsuccessful, in part due to limited capital and the overall downward pressure from other participants. 

As the experiment progressed, I focused on minimizing losses by selling my shares, even at prices below the buyback.  This was particularly crucial in later rounds to avoid being left with shares that would be bought back at a lower price than I had purchased them for. Ultimately, maximizing profit in this environment proved challenging due to the consistent downward trend in market prices, despite some initial attempts to influence the market upwards.
