The experiment demonstrated the potential for market manipulation, even in a simplified setting. While a clear pump-and-dump strategy was not perfectly executed, the market did experience periods of inflated prices followed by a significant downturn. My initial strategy involved accumulating shares, which proved suboptimal given the eventual market decline.  Aggressive selling in the later rounds, as the market declined, generated profit.  Conservative forecasting proved to be more reliable.  The experience highlighted the importance of adapting to changing market dynamics and the potential profitability of exploiting market inefficiencies and irrational behavior. More aggressive buying early on, coupled with coordinated selling (if possible), could maximize the effectiveness of a pump-and-dump scheme in future iterations. Deeper analysis of other participant behaviors and more sophisticated price forecasting would likely improve returns.
