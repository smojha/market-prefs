My pump and dump strategy ultimately failed. While I attempted to create upward price pressure in the early rounds through strategically placed buy and sell orders, I was unable to generate sufficient market momentum.  My initial buy orders, intended to signal confidence and attract other buyers, did not result in any executed trades. The market did not respond as anticipated, with prices fluctuating within a narrow range around 14 for the first ten rounds.  

Furthermore, my attempts to sell at inflated prices in later rounds were also unsuccessful.  As the experiment progressed, I observed the market price trending downwards, indicating a general bearish sentiment among participants. I adjusted my sell orders accordingly but still could not execute profitable trades. My late-round efforts to liquidate my stock holdings were hindered by the falling market price, forcing me to sell at a loss in round 26 in order to avoid the risk of holding stock at the terminal round. In retrospect, I underestimated the difficulty of manipulating the market in an environment where other participants were also actively pursuing their own strategies.  The lack of sufficient capital to create significant buying pressure and the overall market sentiment likely contributed to my failure.
