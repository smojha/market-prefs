My initial strategy involved establishing a consistent presence in the market, submitting both buy and sell orders each round to gauge market sentiment and potentially profit from fluctuations. I maintained a price forecast of 14 for the first several rounds, based on the initial market price and the guaranteed buyback price of 14.  I observed the market price fluctuate within a narrow range but generally around 14. My buy and sell orders at 13 and 15 respectively, were designed to allow for a small profit. These orders were consistently not filled in the early rounds, suggesting a balanced market with participants sharing similar expectations around the fundamental value. 

As rounds progressed and my cash reserves increased through interest and dividends, I shifted towards accumulating stock when the price dipped below 14. This presented opportunities for gains, given the final round's fixed buyback price of 14.  My forecast for future rounds remained conservative, anchored at 14.

I began to sell off shares after round 18 when the price stayed near or above 14, focusing on converting assets into cash. However, a more aggressive sell-off was initiated in the final rounds as the market price began to decline below 14. The goal was to maximize final returns through converting all stocks into cash at the most favorable rates. My decision to sell all remaining stock in the final round was driven by the market's drop to extremely low levels, ensuring maximum return on remaining shares and preventing losses due to the lower market price. My forecast was adjusted in the later rounds to match the prevailing trend, with the aim of securing forecast bonuses. In hindsight, aggressively manipulating the market and creating a bubble (as suggested) was not realistic in this environment, given the conservative actions of other participants.
