Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons learned:

1. Market Behavior:
- Price has remained relatively stable around 14-14.5, close to the buyback value
- Trading volume is low (0-2 per round), suggesting cautious market participants
- Current prices appear reasonable given the 14 buyback value plus dividend potential

2. Strategy Effectiveness:
- My conservative order placement (buy 13, sell 15) resulted in no executions
- May need to tighten spreads to increase chance of execution
- Interest earnings (5%) provided steady income (~5-5.45 per round)
- Dividend payments varied significantly (4.0 vs 1.6), demonstrating the importance of considering average dividend value

3. Key Insights for Main Experiment:
- Fair value calculation: 14 (buyback) + expected future dividends (0.7 per period remaining)
- Need to be more aggressive with order placement to ensure execution when profitable
- Important to maintain sufficient cash buffer for attractive buying opportunities
- Consider reducing stock position as we approach final rounds since buyback value (14) becomes dominant factor
- Monitor other participants' behavior for potential mispricing opportunities

For future rounds, I will adjust my strategy to:
- Place orders closer to market price to increase execution probability
- Maintain flexible position to capitalize on significant deviations from fair value
- Gradually reduce stock exposure in later rounds to lock in profits
