Based on my practice rounds experience, here are key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Dynamics:
- Market prices have stayed close to the fundamental value of 14 (buyback price)
- Trading volume has been low, suggesting cautious trading behavior
- Spread between buy and sell orders (13-15) may be too wide to execute trades

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Interest earnings have been consistent (5% on cash)
- Dividend payments varied (4.0 and 1.6), demonstrating the volatility
- Cash position growing steadily through interest + dividends

3. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Should tighten bid-ask spread to increase likelihood of trade execution
- Need to be more aggressive in pricing when wanting to execute trades
- Current forecasts may be too conservative - could incorporate more price movement

4. Risk Management:
- Important to maintain enough cash for opportunistic buying
- Need to carefully consider trades near 14 price level
- Should avoid holding overpriced stock near experiment end

5. Future Focus:
- Monitor if actual experiment shows different pricing/volume patterns
- Look for price disconnects from fundamental value for trading opportunities
- Consider gradual position adjustment based on remaining periods

This experience suggests a balanced approach combining fundamental value trading with opportunistic position-taking when clear mispricings occur.
