Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Fundamental Value Analysis:
- Each stock provides expected dividend of 0.7 per period (average of 0.4 and 1.0)
- With 5% interest on cash and final buyback value of 14, need to carefully weigh opportunity costs
- Market price hovering around buyback value (14-14.5) suggests relatively efficient pricing

2. Trading Strategy Refinements:
- My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15 (sell) weren't executed, suggesting need to tighten spread
- Low trading volume indicates potential liquidity issues - may need to be more aggressive to execute trades
- Important to maintain cash reserves for opportunistic buying while keeping enough shares for dividend income

3. Risk Management:
- As we approach round 30, stock prices should converge to 14 (buyback value)
- Avoid buying above 14 in later rounds as losses are likely
- Consider reducing stock position if price rises significantly above fundamental value

4. Price Forecasting:
- My conservative forecasts (14-15) were reasonable given observed price stability
- Need to account for both short-term volatility and long-term convergence to buyback value

Key Takeaway: Success requires balancing dividend income, interest earnings, and capital gains while being mindful of the final buyback value. Must be more aggressive with order pricing to ensure execution when desired.
