Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Market Price Analysis:
- Market prices have been relatively stable around 14-14.5, which is close to the terminal value of 14
- Trading volume has been low, suggesting cautious market participation

2. Portfolio Management:
- The 5% interest on cash has been providing steady returns (5-5.45 per round)
- Dividend payments varied between high (4.0) and low (1.6), averaging around the expected 0.7 per share
- My order strategy of placing buys at 13 and sells at 15 hasn't resulted in trades yet - may need to tighten spreads

3. Strategy Adjustments for Main Experiment:
- Calculate fundamental value each round = (remaining periods Ã— avg dividend 0.7) + 14 terminal value
- Be more aggressive in crossing the spread when price deviates significantly from fundamental value
- Keep sufficient cash buffer to take advantage of buying opportunities
- For forecasting, focus on fundamental value and recent price trends
- Near experiment end, avoid holding shares bought above 14 that can't be sold before terminal conversion

4. Risk Management:
- Monitor portfolio balance between stocks and cash to maintain flexibility
- Consider reducing stock holdings if prices rise significantly above fundamental value
- Factor in both dividend income and interest earnings when making trading decisions
