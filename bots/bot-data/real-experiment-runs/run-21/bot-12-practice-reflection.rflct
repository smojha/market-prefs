Based on my practice rounds experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Market prices have been stable around 14-14.5, which is rational given the 14 CASH buyback value. This suggests participants understand the fundamental value.

2. The dividend structure (0.4 or 1.0 with equal probability) means expected dividend is 0.7 per period. With 5% interest rate on cash as alternative, need to carefully evaluate price levels above buyback value.

3. Trading volume has been low (0-2 shares per round), indicating participants are cautious and possibly waiting for better prices. My orders at 13 (buy) and 15-16 (sell) didn't execute, suggesting I need to tighten spreads to complete trades.

4. The cash position has grown steadily from 100 to 125.85 through dividends and interest, without any trading. This demonstrates the value of passive holding when prices are near fundamental value.

5. For the main experiment, I plan to:
   - Set tighter bid-ask spreads to increase chance of execution
   - Buy aggressively if price drops below 13 (good value considering dividends)
   - Sell if price rises above 15 (limited upside due to buyback)
   - Maintain cash reserves for opportunities
   - Be increasingly conservative as we approach round 30 due to buyback risk
