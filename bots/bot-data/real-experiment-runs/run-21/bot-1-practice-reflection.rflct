Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Stability
- The market price has been relatively stable around 14-14.5, which aligns with the fundamental value considering the expected dividend of 0.7 per period and the terminal value of 14.
- Trading volume has been low, suggesting that participants are generally content with their positions at these price levels.

2. Order Execution Strategy
- My initial spread of 13-15 in round 1 was too wide, leading to no executions.
- Even after tightening the spread to 13.5-14.5 in round 2, orders still didn't execute, suggesting I need to be even more aggressive with pricing to participate in the market.
- For future rounds, I should consider crossing the spread when necessary to execute trades, especially if I see profitable opportunities.

3. Portfolio Management
- The combination of dividends (varying between 0.4-1.0) and interest earnings (5% on cash) has been providing steady income.
- With 4 shares and current cash of 125.85, my position is well-balanced, providing both dividend potential and interest earnings.

4. Future Strategy Adjustments
- Need to be more aggressive in order placement to ensure execution when opportunities arise
- Should focus on maintaining a balanced portfolio while looking for short-term trading opportunities when prices deviate from fundamental value
- Important to consider the terminal value of 14 when making trading decisions, especially as we approach later rounds
- Continue monitoring dividend payments to adjust fair value calculations accordingly
