Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Pricing Efficiency:
- The market price has remained relatively stable between 14-14.5, very close to the terminal value of 14
- This suggests participants are pricing the stock rationally considering the terminal value

2. Order Execution:
- My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15 (sell) weren't executed, suggesting I need to tighten spreads
- Low market volume (0-2 shares) indicates I may need to cross the spread more aggressively to execute trades

3. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position grew steadily from 109 to 125.85 through interest (5%) and dividends
- The 4 stock position generated variable dividends (4.0 and 1.6) showing the dividend volatility
- Maintaining the initial stock position was profitable due to dividend income

4. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Consider tightening bid-ask spreads to 13.5-14.5 for better execution
- Focus on accumulating stock below 14 (terminal value) when possible
- Keep sufficient cash buffer to earn interest while maintaining flexibility
- Balance between aggressive order execution and profitable spreads

For the main experiment, I will focus on capitalizing on price inefficiencies while ensuring I don't hold overvalued stock near the terminal period.
