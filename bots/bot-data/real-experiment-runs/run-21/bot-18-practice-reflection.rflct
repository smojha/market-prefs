Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons and strategies I've identified:

1. Price Dynamics:
- Market prices have been relatively stable around 14-14.5, which is consistent with the final buyback value of 14
- Trading volume has been low, suggesting other participants are also being cautious

2. Earnings Strategy:
- The combination of 5% interest on cash and expected dividend of 0.7 per stock provides steady income
- My current portfolio mix (4 stocks + ~126 cash) offers a good balance between dividend income and interest earnings

3. Trading Approach:
- Placing limit orders on both sides of the market (buy 13, sell 15) hasn't resulted in trades yet - may need to tighten spreads
- Being patient with orders is important as rushing to trade at unfavorable prices could lock in losses

4. Risk Management:
- Critical to remember that stocks will be worth exactly 14 at experiment end
- Should avoid buying above 14 in later rounds unless confident can sell higher before end

5. Forward Strategy:
- Continue maintaining balanced portfolio between cash and stock
- Consider more aggressive order placement (tighter spreads) if want to execute trades
- Focus on accumulating steady earnings through dividends and interest
- Pay careful attention to remaining number of rounds when making trading decisions
