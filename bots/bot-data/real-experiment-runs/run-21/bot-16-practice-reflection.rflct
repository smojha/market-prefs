Based on my practice experience, here are the key lessons and observations that will be valuable for the main experiment:

1. Price Discovery and Fundamental Value:
- The market price has stayed relatively close to the terminal value of 14, ranging from 14.0-14.5
- With a 50/50 chance of 0.4 or 1.0 dividend, expected dividend value is 0.7 per period
- Need to factor in both remaining dividends and terminal value when calculating fair price

2. Trading Strategy:
- Buy orders at 13-14 and sell orders at 15-16 haven't executed yet - may need to narrow spread
- Important to be patient and wait for profitable opportunities rather than forcing trades
- Cash position growing steadily through interest (5%) and dividends

3. Risk Management:
- Maintaining balanced portfolio with both cash and stock provides stability
- Cash gives guaranteed 5% return while stock offers variable dividends
- Need to avoid overpaying for stock since terminal value caps upside at 14

4. Future Considerations:
- Price forecasts suggest slight upward trend expected but must converge to 14 by end
- May need to be more aggressive with order placement to get executions
- Watch for patterns in dividend payments and price movements to inform strategy

Key Focus for Main Experiment:
- Calculate and track fundamental value each period
- Place orders closer to market price to increase execution probability
- Maintain flexibility to adjust strategy based on market conditions
- Remember terminal value of 14 caps long-term price appreciation
