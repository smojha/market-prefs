Based on my practice experience, here are key observations and strategies for the main experiment:

1. Market Efficiency:
- Market prices have stayed close to fundamental value (around 14), suggesting participants understand the terminal value
- Volume has been low, indicating cautious trading

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Earned steady income from dividends (0.4-1.0 per share) and interest (5% on cash)
- Conservative order placement (13 buy, 15 sell) helped avoid bad trades but may have been too wide to execute

3. Key Lessons:
- Need to tighten bid-ask spreads to increase probability of execution while maintaining profit margin
- Important to maintain balance between cash (earning interest) and stock (earning dividends)
- Current market price of 14-14.5 is rational given 14 buyback value

4. Strategy Adjustments:
- Will place orders closer to market price (maybe 0.5-1.0 spread) to increase execution probability
- Focus on accumulating shares when price drops below 14 (buyback value)
- Consider selling when price rises significantly above 14 as downside risk increases

5. Risk Management:
- Continue monitoring cash levels to maintain flexibility
- Avoid large positions that could be difficult to unwind near experiment end
- Remember shares convert to 14 cash regardless of final market price
