Based on the practice rounds, here are my key observations and lessons learned:

1. Market Dynamics:
- The market price has been relatively stable around 14-14.5, close to the final buyback value of 14
- Trading volume was low (0-2 shares per round), suggesting limited market liquidity
- My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15 (sell) weren't getting filled, indicating I need to tighten my spreads

2. Portfolio Performance:
- Cash position grew steadily from 109 to 125.85 due to consistent interest (5%) and dividend payments
- Maintaining 4 shares has provided stable dividend income (mix of 0.4 and 1.0 per share)
- The combined return from interest and dividends provides a good baseline income

3. Strategy Adjustments Needed:
- Should tighten bid-ask spread to increase probability of order execution (maybe 13.5-14.5 range)
- With buyback value at 14, buying below 14 provides guaranteed profit opportunity
- Need to be more careful about holding shares above 14 near the end of experiment
- May need to cross the spread occasionally to execute desired trades

4. Price Forecasting:
- My forecasts (14-15) have been aligned with actual prices
- The 5 cash unit reward for accurate forecasts provides additional income opportunity
- Should continue monitoring price trends for better forecast accuracy

For the main experiment, I'll focus on:
1. Getting more trades executed by adjusting order prices
2. Maintaining balanced exposure to both dividend and interest income
3. Being mindful of the 14 buyback value when trading
4. Capitalizing on forecast rewards through careful price predictions
