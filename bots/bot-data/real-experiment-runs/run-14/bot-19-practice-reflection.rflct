During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14.0 and increased to 15.0 by the second round. Despite submitting buy orders at or below the market price, no trades were executed, suggesting a low liquidity or a reluctance among other participants to trade at these prices. This observation aligns with my insight that other participants might be holding out for higher prices or are not actively trading. The fixed buyback price of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment provides a clear ceiling for the stock's value, which I must keep in mind for future trading decisions, especially as we approach the final rounds.

My current portfolio includes 4 shares of stock and 120.81 units of cash, with the stock valued at 60.0 based on the last round's market price of 15.0. Given the buyback price of 14.0, I need to carefully consider whether buying additional shares at or above the current market price is beneficial, especially since the trade-in value is lower than the market price in the last round.

For the main experiment, I plan to continue observing market trends and adapt my strategies accordingly. I will experiment with different limit prices to better understand market liquidity and the willingness of other participants to trade at various price points. Balancing the holding of cash for interest and stocks for dividends will be crucial to optimize my portfolio for maximum earnings by the end of the experiment. Additionally, I will use the outcomes of my price forecasts to refine my trading strategy, ensuring that my decisions are informed by both current market conditions and future price expectations.

Overall, the practice rounds have highlighted the importance of strategic flexibility and the need to closely monitor market dynamics and participant behavior to maximize my earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
