During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock increased from 14.0 in Round 1 to 15.0 in Round 2. My initial strategy was to attempt to buy one share at the market price of 14.0 in Round 1, but the order did not execute. In Round 2, I chose not to submit any orders, which resulted in no change to my portfolio holdings. My cash balance increased due to interest and dividends earned, which is a positive aspect of holding both cash and stock.

Key insights from the practice rounds include:
1. The stock's market price is currently higher than its buyback value of 14.0, suggesting that it might be beneficial to sell shares if the price continues to rise above this threshold, especially as we approach the final rounds where the stock will be converted at 14.0.
2. The importance of timing in buying and selling stocks is critical, as seen by my unsuccessful attempt to buy at 14.0 in Round 1.
3. The forecasts I made were conservative and did not cover all required periods in Round 2, which I need to improve on to maximize forecast winnings.

Moving forward into the main experiment, my strategy will involve:
1. Monitoring the market price closely and selling shares if the price significantly exceeds the buyback value, particularly in later rounds.
2. Attempting to buy shares when the market price is at or below the buyback value, aiming to benefit from dividends and potential price increases.
3. Ensuring I submit forecasts for all required periods, aiming to stay within the 2.5 unit range of the actual market price to earn the forecasting reward.

Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in shaping a more informed approach to trading in the main experiment, focusing on maximizing total earnings through strategic buying and selling, as well as accurate forecasting.
