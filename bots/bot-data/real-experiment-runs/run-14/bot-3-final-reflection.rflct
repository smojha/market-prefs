Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy evolved from maintaining a balance between stock and cash to executing a pump-and-dump strategy as instructed. Initially, I focused on selling stocks at a higher price than the buyback value of 14.0, which allowed me to accumulate cash while still holding onto stocks for dividend income. As the market price stabilized around 18.0, I began to shift my focus towards inflating the market price further.

In the later rounds, I increased my buying activity to drive up demand and volume, aiming to create a bubble in the stock price. I successfully acquired more shares, reaching a total of 11 by the final round, with the market price remaining at 18.0. This was well above the buyback price, aligning with my goal to inflate the market price.

However, I did not sell any shares in the last round as per my plan to hold onto them until the end, anticipating that the market would continue to be influenced by my buying pressure. This strategy did not fully capitalize on the peak price, which could have been higher if I had managed to push the price further up before selling.

For future experiments, to maximize the effectiveness of a pump-and-dump strategy, I should consider more aggressive buying in earlier rounds to inflate the price significantly and then sell off a substantial portion of my holdings when the price reaches a peak, ideally before the final round. This would ensure I profit from the inflated price before any potential market correction.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were generally accurate, which helped in maintaining a steady cash flow through forecasting rewards. However, these forecasts were not leveraged to manipulate the market further, which could be a consideration for future strategies.

Overall, while I managed to accumulate a significant number of shares and maintain a high cash balance, the execution of the pump-and-dump strategy could have been more aggressive to achieve higher profits from the market manipulation.
