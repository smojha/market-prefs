During the practice rounds, I observed the market dynamics and tested my initial strategies. In Round 1, I submitted a BUY order at 13.0 and a SELL order at 15.0, but no trades were executed, suggesting that my orders did not meet the market conditions at that time. The market price was 14.0, which was higher than my buy order but lower than my sell order. In Round 2, I chose not to submit any orders, as I wanted to observe further market trends without altering my position. The market price increased to 15.0, indicating a potential upward trend.

My current portfolio at the start of Round 3 consists of 4 shares of STOCK and 120.81 units of CASH, with the stock valued at 60.0 based on the last round's market price. The STOCK trade-in value at the end of the experiment is set at 14.0 per share, which is lower than the current market price. This suggests that holding onto the STOCK until the end might not be the most profitable strategy unless the market price drops below 14.0.

For future rounds, I plan to be more aggressive with my trading, aiming to buy STOCK when the market price is close to or below the trade-in value of 14.0, and sell when it rises above 15.0, capitalizing on the price fluctuations. I will also continue to monitor the dividend payments and interest earnings to optimize my cash flow.

Regarding my price forecasts, I will refine my predictions based on observed trends and adjust them to stay within the 2.5-unit margin for reward eligibility. In the practice rounds, my forecasts were somewhat accurate for the immediate round but became less so for further rounds, indicating a need for better long-term market prediction strategies.

Overall, the practice rounds have been useful for understanding the market's behavior and refining my trading and forecasting strategies. I will apply these insights in the upcoming experimental rounds to maximize my total earnings.
