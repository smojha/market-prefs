My strategy of gradually acquiring more shares has paid off, as I now hold 11 shares. With the buyback price set at 14, holding onto these shares until the end of the experiment is beneficial. The dividends received have been a steady source of income, and the interest on cash has been significant but less impactful compared to the potential gains from the stock buyback.
