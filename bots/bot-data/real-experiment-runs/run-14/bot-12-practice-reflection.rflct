During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback value of 14, which suggests a stable market environment. My strategies of holding, buying low, and selling high were not executed due to the market price not aligning with my set limits. This indicates that my limit orders might need to be adjusted closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. The dividend collection strategy worked well, as I earned dividends consistently, which, combined with the interest on cash, helped increase my cash reserves. As we approach the final rounds, I will need to be more aggressive in my trading, especially if the market price is significantly different from the buyback price. My forecasting was relatively accurate for the short term but less so for longer-term predictions, suggesting a need for better analysis or perhaps more conservative forecasts. Overall, I need to refine my trading limits, continue benefiting from dividends and interest, and adapt my endgame strategy based on market trends and proximity to the final round.
