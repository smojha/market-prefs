During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock remained relatively stable, starting at 14.0 and increasing to 15.0 by the second round. Despite my attempts to buy and sell stocks with limit orders set at or around these prices, no trades were executed, indicating a lack of liquidity or aggressive pricing necessary to initiate trades. This suggests that in the main experiment, I should consider setting more competitive prices to encourage trade execution.

The consistent earning of dividends (1.6 per round) and interest (5.0 and 5.33 in rounds 1 and 2, respectively) from my initial holdings of 4 stocks and 100 units of cash highlights the importance of balancing my portfolio to maximize these passive income sources. The buyback price of 14.0 per share at the end of the experiment further influences my strategy, as it sets a clear benchmark for the stock's value, suggesting that buying stocks at or below this price could be beneficial.

My price forecasting was somewhat off, as the market price increased from 14 to 15, deviating from my forecasts. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting model, potentially incorporating more recent market trends and dynamics. For future rounds, I will adjust my forecasts to be more responsive to observed market movements.

In summary, my strategy moving forward will involve more aggressive pricing to initiate trades, maintaining a balanced portfolio to maximize dividends and interest, and refining my price forecasting to better align with actual market prices. These adjustments should help me maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experimental rounds.
