In reflecting on the experiment, my primary goal was to execute a pump-and-dump strategy, which involved manipulating the market to inflate the stock price above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. However, the market dynamics and my trading strategy did not align well with this objective.

Initially, I held onto my shares, expecting the market price to rise due to the potential of dividend earnings. As the market price began to stabilize and increase above the buyback value of 14.0, I attempted to sell shares at higher prices, successfully executing sales at 17.0 in Rounds 5, 8, and 9. However, my strategy to buy back shares at lower prices was less effective, as my buy orders were not filled, likely due to the market price remaining high.

As the experiment progressed, I shifted towards accumulating cash, which proved beneficial due to the 5% interest rate per period. By Round 30, I had sold all my shares and accumulated a significant amount of cash, totaling 712.46 units. This approach was driven by the realization that the market price was consistently above the buyback value, making it more profitable to hold cash rather than stock.

The pump-and-dump strategy was not successfully executed due to the inability to inflate the market price further and the lack of trading volume necessary to create a bubble. The market's stability above the buyback value and the absence of significant price fluctuations limited my ability to manipulate the market as intended.

For future experiments, a more aggressive approach to buying and selling could be employed earlier to create the necessary volatility for a pump-and-dump strategy. Additionally, collaborating with other participants to artificially inflate the price might be necessary to create a bubble. However, this would require careful coordination and a deeper understanding of market psychology.

In conclusion, while I managed to maximize my cash holdings and earn a total payment of $15.74, the pump-and-dump strategy was not successful. The insights gained from this experiment suggest that more dynamic and possibly collaborative strategies are needed to manipulate market prices effectively.
