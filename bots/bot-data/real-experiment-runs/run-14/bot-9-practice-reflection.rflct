During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated around the buyback price of 14, with prices at 14 in Round 1 and 15 in Round 2. My strategy of attempting to buy at or below 14 was partially successful, as I managed to purchase an additional share in Round 1 but was unable to execute a trade in Round 2 due to the higher market price. This suggests that setting buy orders at the buyback price may not always be executed, especially if the market price rises above this threshold.

The dividends and interest earned have been significant, with dividends at 2.0 per round and interest at around 4.5 per round, indicating that maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stocks is beneficial. My current portfolio of 5 shares and 105.87 cash units reflects a good balance, considering the stock value at the current market price and the upcoming buyback.

My price forecasts have been slightly off, with the actual market price deviating from my predictions. This indicates a need to refine my forecasting model, possibly by considering more recent trends and the stability around the buyback price. Accurate forecasting could lead to additional rewards, which would enhance my total earnings.

As we move into the main experiment, I plan to continue testing and refining my strategies, particularly focusing on buying stocks at or below the buyback price and selling when the market price significantly exceeds this value. I will also adapt my strategies dynamically as market conditions change, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. The insights gained from the practice rounds will be invaluable in guiding my decisions in the main experiment.
