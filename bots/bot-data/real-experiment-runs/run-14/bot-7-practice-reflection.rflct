During the practice rounds, I observed that the stock price stabilized around the buyback value of 14, which aligns with the end-game scenario. This suggests that the market perceives the stock's intrinsic value to be closely tied to its final conversion rate. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any trades, indicating that the market price remained within a tight range, which is consistent with the observed market prices of 14 in Round 1 and 15 in Round 2. This experience reinforced the importance of setting realistic order prices that are likely to be executed based on market trends.

In terms of dividends, I earned a consistent 1.6 units of cash per round, which, combined with the 5% interest on cash, provided a steady income stream. This highlights the benefit of maintaining a balanced portfolio between cash and stocks to maximize returns from both dividends and interest.

My forecasts for future rounds were slightly optimistic, predicting a gradual increase in stock price. However, the actual price movements were more conservative, suggesting that I need to adjust my forecasting approach to better reflect the market's behavior, particularly considering the proximity to the buyback price.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I will refine my strategy by:
1. Adjusting my buy and sell orders closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of execution.
2. Continuing to balance my holdings between cash and stocks to optimize dividend and interest earnings.
3. Reassessing my price forecasts to be more aligned with the observed market stability around the buyback price.

Overall, the practice rounds have provided valuable insights into market dynamics and the importance of aligning my trading strategies with the expected end-game scenario.
