During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback price of 14, which aligns with the insights noted in my INSIGHTS.txt file about participants being aware of the end-game value of the stock. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below the market price did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market was not willing to sell at my proposed prices. This indicates a need for more aggressive bidding if I aim to increase my stock holdings before the final rounds. The increase in market price from 14 to 15 over the practice rounds, coupled with my unchanged number of shares until the last round, suggests a cautious approach by other participants, possibly due to the nearing end of the experiment and the known buyback price. In the last practice round, I managed to acquire an additional share, increasing my holdings to 5, which reflects a slight shift in market dynamics or possibly a response to my more aggressive bidding strategy. My cash position decreased slightly due to the purchase, but the stock value increased, which is promising given the potential for dividend earnings. Moving forward, I need to closely monitor the market price relative to the buyback price and be prepared to adjust my strategy, possibly selling if the market price significantly exceeds the buyback value, or buying more aggressively if the price remains stable or decreases. The 5% interest on cash remains a safe return, but the potential for higher dividends from stocks could be more lucrative if managed correctly. As we approach the final rounds, balancing the risk and reward between holding cash and investing in stocks will be crucial, and I must remain flexible in my approach to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
