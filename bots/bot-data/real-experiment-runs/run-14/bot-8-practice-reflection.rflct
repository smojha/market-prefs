During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated between 14 and 15, which is close to the buyback value of 14. This suggests that the market price is relatively stable and closely tied to the buyback value, which is crucial information for decision-making in the main experiment. My strategy of attempting to buy stocks at a price below 14 was not executed, possibly due to the market not reaching that price point or other participants not selling at that price. This indicates a need to possibly adjust my buying threshold slightly higher if the market consistently stays above 14, especially as we approach the end of the experiment when the buyback price becomes more relevant.

The dividends earned from stocks (1.6 per round) combined with the interest from cash (ranging from 5.0 to 5.33 per round) provided a steady income, reinforcing the importance of balancing my portfolio between stocks and cash. The interest rate on cash is significant and should not be overlooked as a source of earnings.

My price forecasting was based on slight increments over time, which did not align well with the actual market movements observed. For the main experiment, I will need to refine my forecasting approach, possibly by incorporating more recent market trends and considering the stability around the buyback value more closely.

As we move into the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely and be more flexible with my buying and selling thresholds. If the market price stays consistently above 14, I may need to buy at a higher price to secure stocks for dividend earnings, while also considering selling when the price is favorable but still mindful of the buyback value at the end. The insights gained from these practice rounds will be invaluable in adapting my strategies for the main experiment to maximize my total earnings.
