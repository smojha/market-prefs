During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at the buyback value of 14.0 and increased to 15.0 by the second round. This suggests a potential upward trend in the market, although the volume remained low, indicating cautious trading among participants. My strategy of not selling my stocks when the market price was at or below the buyback value seems to have been prudent, as it allowed me to maintain my position and benefit from dividends and interest.

In the first round, I did not engage in any trades, which was consistent with the overall market behavior. I accurately forecasted the price for the first round but overestimated for future rounds. In the second round, I attempted to buy a share at a lower price than the market, which did not execute, indicating that the market price was stable or rising. My cash increased due to interest and dividends, showing the benefit of holding both assets.

Moving into the third practice round, my number of shares decreased to 3, suggesting a trade occurred that was not detailed in the provided data. My cash increased significantly, possibly due to selling a share at a favorable price. The market price being above the buyback value at 15.0 poses a decision point: whether to buy more shares at this price, considering the potential for higher dividends and the risk of the price dropping below the buyback value by the end of the experiment.

Key takeaways from the practice rounds include the importance of monitoring market trends closely and adjusting strategies based on whether the market price is above or below the buyback value. Accurate forecasting remains crucial for additional earnings, and maintaining a balance between cash and stocks to leverage both interest and dividends is essential. For future rounds, I plan to continue this approach, being ready to buy more stocks if the price falls below 14.0 and holding onto stocks as long as the market price does not exceed 14.0 significantly, while keeping a cash reserve for opportunities and interest earnings.
