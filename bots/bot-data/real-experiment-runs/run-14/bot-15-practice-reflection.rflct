During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14, which aligns with the buyback price, suggesting an initial fair valuation of the stock. The price increased to 15 in the second round, indicating potential upward pressure on the stock price. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 14 and a sell order at 15 in the second round did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that the market may not have been liquid enough at those prices or that other participants had different valuation thresholds.

The dividends received were consistently high at 1.6 per round, reinforcing the potential profitability of holding stocks. However, the interest earned on cash also increased, providing a stable, albeit lower, return. This balance between the potential high returns from dividends and the guaranteed returns from cash interest is crucial for optimizing my portfolio.

As we approach the actual experiment, I need to refine my strategy based on these observations. Given the buyback price of 14, I should be cautious about purchasing stocks above this value as we near round 30, as there is a risk of loss if I cannot sell them at a higher market price. My forecasts for future rounds were incrementally optimistic, which may need adjustment based on real-time market dynamics.

Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market liquidity and price trends closely, adjusting my buy and sell orders to align more closely with market conditions. I will also experiment with different price points for orders to better understand the market's response and optimize my trading strategy. Additionally, maintaining a balance between cash and stocks will be essential to leverage both dividend earnings and interest income effectively. As the experiment progresses, I will need to be particularly mindful of my stock holdings as we approach the final rounds to ensure I maximize my earnings at the buyback conversion.
