During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price started at 14.0 and increased to 15.0, which is above the buyback price of 14.0. This indicates a potential overvaluation of the stock compared to its guaranteed buyback value at the end of the experiment. My strategy of placing limit orders slightly below and above the current market price did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that other participants were not willing to trade at those prices. This might indicate a cautious approach among participants or a general satisfaction with the current stock valuation.

The dividends received in both rounds were 1.6, which is the lower end of the possible dividend range. This, combined with the 5% interest on cash, suggests that holding a balanced portfolio of both cash and stock could be beneficial. However, with the stock price at 15.0, which is higher than the buyback price, it might be prudent to consider selling stocks if the price continues to rise above 14.0, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.

My forecasts for future rounds were incrementally increasing, which might need adjustment based on the observed stability and the fact that the stock price is already above the buyback price. For future rounds, I will need to refine my forecasting strategy to better anticipate market movements and ensure my predictions fall within the reward threshold.

Moving forward, I will adjust my limit orders to be more aggressive in selling if the price continues to rise above 14.0, while still maintaining some stock to benefit from potential high dividends. I will also continue to monitor the impact of dividends and interest on my cash position, aiming to maximize total earnings by the end of the 30 rounds. Additionally, I will refine my forecasting strategy to better align with the observed market trends and the buyback price.
