The experiment highlighted several key strategies and insights that were effective in maximizing earnings. Initially, maintaining a conservative approach in price forecasting around 14 proved beneficial, especially towards the end of the experiment. This stability in forecasting was validated by the market price, which remained around 13-14 for most of the rounds, aligning with the observations from the practice rounds.

Aggressive selling of shares towards the end of the experiment was crucial. This strategy allowed for the maximization of cash holdings, ensuring that all shares were sold before the automatic conversion at the end of the 30th round. By the final round, all shares were successfully converted to cash, resulting in a considerable amount of cash that contributed to the final earnings.

Throughout the experiment, it was essential to adapt to market dynamics. The market price generally remained stable, but there were opportunities to buy and sell strategically. The practice of submitting multiple limit orders to buy and sell at varying prices helped in capitalizing on market movements. Additionally, the interest earned on cash holdings provided a steady return, complementing the dividends earned from holding stocks.

Reflecting on the overall experience, the strategy of aggressive selling towards the end, combined with conservative price forecasting and strategic order submissions, proved to be effective. These insights will be invaluable for future trading experiments.
