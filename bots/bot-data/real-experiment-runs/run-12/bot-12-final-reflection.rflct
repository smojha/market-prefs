The experiment was a valuable learning experience, especially in understanding market dynamics and the importance of strategic planning. Initially, I focused on buying stocks at a lower price and selling at a higher price to maximize profit. However, as the rounds progressed, I realized the importance of accurate price forecasting to earn additional rewards. This insight was crucial in the final rounds, where strategic selling became essential to avoid the buyback price and maximize cash earnings. The practice rounds were particularly useful in refining my strategy. Key takeaways include the importance of diversifying orders, adapting to market conditions, and the significance of dividends and interest in accumulating wealth. Overall, the experiment highlighted the need for a balanced approach between trading and forecasting to achieve optimal results.
