During the practice rounds, I noticed that the market price remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. My submitted orders did not execute, indicating a need to adjust my price points to better align with market conditions. The steady 5% return on cash and variable dividends from stocks emphasize the importance of diversification. For the upcoming rounds, I plan to continue observing market trends and adjusting my orders more aggressively to ensure trades are executed. Additionally, the buyback price of 14 at the end of the experiment should be a key consideration in the final rounds to avoid potential losses. Maintaining a balanced portfolio and adapting strategies based on market dynamics will be crucial for maximizing earnings.
