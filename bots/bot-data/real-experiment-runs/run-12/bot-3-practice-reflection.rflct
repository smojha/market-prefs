During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around 14, which aligns with the cautious approach from participants as noted in INSIGHTS.txt. The lack of executed trades suggests that my orders were not aggressive enough, particularly given the low market volume. This indicates a need to adjust my strategies to better match market conditions and ensure order execution. For future rounds, I plan to continue testing the conservative strategy by holding a balanced portfolio of cash and stock, but I will also consider being more adaptive with my order prices. Accurate price forecasting can significantly boost earnings, so I will pay close attention to market trends and adjust my forecasts accordingly. Additionally, I will monitor market volume and adjust my orders to increase the likelihood of execution, possibly by crossing the spread as needed.
