During the practice rounds, I noticed that my conservative pricing strategy did not result in any executed trades. Despite submitting buy and sell orders, the market price remained relatively stable, and my orders were not aggressive enough to see any trades executed. This suggests that the market may require more competitive pricing to facilitate trades.

Additionally, my price forecasts were slightly off, indicating a need to better understand market dynamics and perhaps be more flexible in my predictions. For future rounds, I plan to submit more aggressive buy and sell orders to test the market's response and adjust my forecasting strategy to be more adaptive to market changes.

Balancing the dividend earnings with the risk of buying stock at high prices, especially towards the end of the experiment, will be crucial. Given the trade-in value of 14 per share, I need to be cautious about buying stock at prices significantly higher than this value as the experiment nears its conclusion.
