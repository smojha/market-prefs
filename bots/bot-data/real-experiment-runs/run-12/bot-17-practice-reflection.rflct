During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. This indicates that the market might be cautious about exceeding this value, given the conversion at the end of the experiment. The dividend yield varied between 0.4 and 1.0, which can significantly impact earnings. Interest on cash provided a steady return, which is a safe option when the market is uncertain. My submitted orders to buy at 13.0 and sell at 15.0 did not execute, suggesting that the market might be more conservative. Adapting strategies based on market volume and other participants' behaviors seems crucial. For future rounds, I will consider lowering my buy orders slightly below the market price and raising my sell orders slightly above to increase the likelihood of executing trades. Additionally, I will continue to monitor the dividend yield and adjust my strategy accordingly. It's important to be mindful of the buyback price of 14 as the experiment progresses, especially in the later rounds.
