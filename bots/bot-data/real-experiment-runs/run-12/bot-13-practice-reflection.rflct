During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable, hovering around 14 to 15 cash per share. This stability suggests that the market may not be highly volatile, which can be beneficial for strategic buying and selling. However, no trades were executed in the first two rounds, indicating that my orders might not have been competitive enough. I need to be more aggressive in setting my BUY and SELL prices to ensure trades are executed. Additionally, the dividend payouts significantly impacted my cash holdings, reinforcing the potential value of holding STOCK. The 5% interest on cash also provided a steady increase, making it crucial to balance between holding cash and investing in STOCK. For future rounds, I plan to be more proactive in adjusting my order prices based on market conditions and aim to buy low and sell high while keeping an eye on the final buyback price of 14 cash per share to avoid losses near the end of the experiment.
