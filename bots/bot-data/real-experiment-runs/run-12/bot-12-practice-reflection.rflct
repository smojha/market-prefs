During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price has been relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. This suggests that the market participants are aware of the terminal value of the stock and are pricing it accordingly. The low market volume indicates limited liquidity, which means that testing the market with small trades is a prudent strategy. My attempts to buy and sell small numbers of shares were met with mixed success, highlighting the need for careful limit pricing and patience in order execution. Balancing between holding cash for interest and stock for dividends is crucial, as both contribute significantly to cash holdings. Adaptability in strategies is essential, given the dynamic nature of the market. For future rounds, I plan to continue experimenting with small trades and adjusting my strategies based on market reactions and dividend impacts.
