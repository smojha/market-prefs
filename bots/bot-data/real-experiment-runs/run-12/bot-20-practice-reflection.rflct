During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. My initial strategy of submitting buy and sell orders around this price did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market might be cautious and that other participants are also considering the buyback price and dividend earnings. My forecasts were generally accurate, reflecting the stability of the market. For the main experiment, I plan to continue testing the market by adjusting my limit prices more aggressively and considering the potential dividend earnings more closely. I will also focus on forecasting prices more strategically, taking into account the market's stability and potential changes. Additionally, I will keep an eye on the approaching end of the experiment to avoid buying shares at prices significantly higher than the buyback value of 14.
