Throughout the experiment, several key strategies and insights emerged that helped maximize earnings. Initially, the focus was on maintaining a stable portfolio by balancing stock ownership and cash liquidity. The practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of liquidity, especially as the final rounds approached.

One critical observation was the stability of the market price around 13-14, aligning with the buyback price of 14. This stability underscored the need to focus on liquidity and avoid overbuying stocks, particularly in the later rounds. The strategy of selling remaining shares at a price slightly above 13 to maximize cash before the final buyback proved effective.

Price forecasting accuracy improved over time, contributing to additional cash rewards. The strategy of setting forecasts within a reasonable range of historical prices and market trends was beneficial. However, there is room for improvement in forecasting, especially for longer-term predictions.

Reflecting on the experiment, the importance of adaptability and continuous monitoring of market trends cannot be overstated. Future strategies should prioritize liquidity and cautious buying, especially in the final rounds. Additionally, refining forecasting techniques and staying attuned to market dynamics will be crucial for maximizing earnings in future experiments.
