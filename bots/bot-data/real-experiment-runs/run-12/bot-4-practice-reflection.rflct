During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the stock fluctuated between 14 and 15. My submitted orders did not execute, likely because the spread between my buy and sell orders was too wide. The dividends earned varied between 0.4 and 1.0, which aligns with the expected dividend of 0.7. The interest earned on cash was consistent at 5%. My forecasts were mostly within a reasonable range but did not always align with the actual market prices. For future rounds, I plan to narrow the spread between buy and sell orders to increase the likelihood of execution. Additionally, I will monitor the market price more closely and adjust my forecasts accordingly. I will also consider the trade-in value of 14 per share when deciding whether to buy or sell stock, especially as the end of the experiment approaches. Overall, it's crucial to balance between holding cash for steady interest and investing in stock for dividends, while being mindful of the market price relative to the expected dividends.
