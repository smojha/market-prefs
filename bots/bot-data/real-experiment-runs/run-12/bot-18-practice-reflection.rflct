During the practice rounds, the market price remained stable at 14.0 for the first two rounds, which aligns with the buyback price at the end of the experiment. This suggests that participants might be cautious and are likely considering the terminal value of the stock. No trades were executed, indicating a conservative approach among participants. The slight increase in market price to 15.0 in the last round might signal a shift in market sentiment or a test by some participants. My strategy of submitting buy and sell orders around the equilibrium price of 14.0 was not successful in executing trades, but it provided valuable insights into market dynamics. For future rounds, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, adjusting my orders to be more competitive, and focusing on acquiring stock below the buyback price of 14.0 to maximize earnings. Additionally, I will be more cautious with my price forecasts, considering the stability observed in the market price.
