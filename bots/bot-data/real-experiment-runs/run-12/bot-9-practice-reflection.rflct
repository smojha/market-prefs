During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price has been relatively stable, hovering around the buyback price of 14. This stability indicates that extreme BUY or SELL prices may not be effective, as noted in my INSIGHTS.TXT. In the first practice round, my submitted orders were not executed, likely because my BUY price was too low and my SELL price was too high. In the second round, my BUY order at the market price was executed, increasing my stock holdings. This suggests that being closer to the market price increases the likelihood of execution, which is in line with my plan in PLANS.TXT.

Given the current market price of 15 and my stock value of 75, I need to be cautious about buying more stocks at prices significantly above the buyback price of 14, especially as the end of the experiment approaches. The interest earned on cash is a reliable 5%, so maintaining a balance between cash and stock is crucial. 

For forecasting, my predictions were close to the actual prices, but I will need to refine my strategy to ensure accuracy within the 2.5 unit range to maximize forecast winnings. Analyzing market data more closely, as planned, will be key in improving my forecasts.

Moving forward, I will continue to test conservative strategies, adjust my orders to be closer to the market price, and focus on balancing my stock and cash holdings to maximize total earnings.
