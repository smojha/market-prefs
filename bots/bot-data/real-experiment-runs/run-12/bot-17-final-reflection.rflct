Throughout the experiment, I maintained a strategy of holding cash and earning interest, particularly in the final rounds, to avoid potential losses from holding stock that may not sell at a higher price. The market showed stability around the buyback price of 14, which reinforced my decision to accumulate cash as a safer option. The interest on cash provided a steady return, which was a safe choice when the market was uncertain. However, I did not engage in any significant trading activity, which limited my ability to profit from market movements. My forecasts were generally accurate, but I did not capitalize on these predictions to buy or sell stock. In retrospect, I could have been more aggressive in trading, especially during periods when the market price was below the buyback price. This would have allowed me to take advantage of the buyback value at the end of the experiment. Additionally, I could have considered a more dynamic strategy, such as buying stock when the price was low and selling when it was high, to maximize profits. Overall, while my strategy ensured a steady income from interest, it lacked the potential for higher returns that could have been achieved through active trading.
