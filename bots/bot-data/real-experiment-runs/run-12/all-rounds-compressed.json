Be cautious in the latter rounds to avoid buying stock at prices higher than 14.",
            "insight": "Buying stock at favorable prices (around 15.0 or below) can be beneficial, especially in the earlier rounds. Accurate price forecasts can significantly boost earnings. Adapting strategies based on market dynamics is crucial for maximizing earnings. The market has shown stability at 15.0, which can be used to make informed decisions for future rounds. It's important to be mindful of the buyback price of 14 per share at the end of the experiment to avoid potential losses.",
