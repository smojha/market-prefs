During the practice rounds, I managed to increase my cash holdings significantly by selling stock at favorable prices. The strategy of testing the market by selling stock proved effective, as it allowed me to earn interest on the increased cash holdings. Additionally, the dividends earned from the stock before selling contributed to my overall earnings. The market price remained relatively stable, which made forecasting straightforward. However, I need to be mindful of the buyback price of 14 per share at the end of the experiment. This means that buying stock at prices higher than 14, especially in the latter rounds, could result in losses. For future rounds, I plan to continue monitoring market dynamics closely and adjust my buying and selling strategies accordingly. I will also focus on improving my price forecasts to maximize the reward from accurate predictions.
