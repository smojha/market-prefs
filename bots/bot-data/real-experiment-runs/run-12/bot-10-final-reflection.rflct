Throughout the experiment, I adapted my strategy based on market dynamics and my own insights. Initially, I aimed to accumulate shares and maximize dividend earnings while maintaining a cautious approach to forecasting. However, as the experiment progressed, I recognized the importance of liquidating my stock holdings to avoid the risk of their value being terminated at 14 units per share. My decision to sell off shares in the latter rounds was crucial, as it allowed me to capitalize on the market price and accumulate cash, which ultimately contributed to my final earnings. My price forecasting strategy was generally accurate, as evidenced by the market bonus I received. However, there is room for improvement in my forecasting accuracy to maximize the forecast bonus in future experiments. Overall, my strategy of cautious accumulation followed by strategic liquidation proved effective in maximizing my earnings.
