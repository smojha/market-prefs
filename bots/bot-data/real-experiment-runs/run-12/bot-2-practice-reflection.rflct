During the first two practice rounds, I observed a lack of liquidity in the market, as no trades were executed despite submitting reasonable buy and sell orders. This suggests that other participants might be cautious or holding onto their positions. The market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. Given the dividend and interest mechanisms, it's crucial to balance between holding cash for interest and stock for dividends. For the next practice round, I plan to be more aggressive with my orders to test the market's response and understand the price elasticity better. I will continue to monitor the market dynamics closely and adjust my strategies accordingly. Additionally, I will refine my price forecasting to improve accuracy and maximize forecast winnings.
