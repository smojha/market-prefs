During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price stabilized around 14.0, which aligns with the buyback price. This makes it a safe threshold for buying stocks, as any stock bought below this price will not result in a loss at the end of the experiment. Holding stocks seems more beneficial than holding cash due to the dividend payouts and the stable market price. The dividend payments and interest earnings significantly impact the cash balance, making it crucial to monitor these closely. The market volume indicates some trading activity, which can be leveraged for strategic buying and selling. Experimenting with higher limit prices for sell orders showed that the market might be willing to pay more, especially when the market price increased to 15.0 in the last round. This suggests that there is potential for profit by selling stocks at a higher price closer to the end of the experiment. Continuing to test the market by submitting both buy and sell orders will help in understanding the market dynamics better. Adapting strategies based on dividend payments and market price fluctuations will be key to maximizing earnings.
