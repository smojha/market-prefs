During the practice rounds, I observed the following key points:

1. **Market Price Stability**: The market price remained relatively stable at 14.0 in the first two rounds, suggesting a cautious trading environment. However, it increased to 15.0 in the third round, indicating potential volatility.

2. **Dividend Impact**: The dividend earnings significantly affect the market price and trading decisions. The fluctuation in dividends (0.4 to 1.0) can lead to price adjustments.

3. **Order Execution**: No executed trades in the first two rounds highlight the importance of more aggressive pricing strategies to ensure orders are filled. This is particularly crucial in a low-volume market.

4. **Price Forecasting**: My price forecasts were conservative and close to the actual prices, which is a good strategy to minimize risk. However, I need to be more adaptive to market changes, especially when the market price deviates from the initial baseline.

5. **Buyback Consideration**: The buyback price of 14 per share is a critical factor. Buying stocks at or below this price is a safe long-term strategy, especially as the experiment nears its end.

6. **Cash Management**: The steady 5% interest on cash provides a reliable return. It's important to balance between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends.

7. **Adaptive Strategy**: Market dynamics can change over time, so it's essential to adjust strategies accordingly. For example, being more aggressive with sell orders and conservative with buy orders might be necessary as the experiment progresses.

8. **Risk Management**: As the experiment nears the end, it's crucial to manage risk by not buying stocks at prices significantly higher than the buyback price of 14. This ensures that any unsold stocks are not terminated at a loss.

9. **Order Submission**: Submitting multiple orders each round can increase the chances of execution, especially in a low-volume market. It's also important to monitor market conditions closely to decide whether to cross the spread for buy/sell orders.

10. **Future Strategy**: For the main experiment, I plan to continue with a balanced trading strategy, focusing on buying stocks at or below the market price of 14. I will adjust my buying strategy based on dividend earnings and market conditions, and be more aggressive with sell orders to maximize profits.
