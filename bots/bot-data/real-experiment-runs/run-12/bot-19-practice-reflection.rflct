During the practice rounds, I observed that the market was relatively stable with prices hovering around 14-15. My attempts to buy or sell at moderate prices (13 and 15) did not result in any executed trades, indicating that the market might be cautious or that the spread between buy and sell orders is significant. This suggests that more aggressive pricing or crossing the spread might be necessary to execute trades.

My price forecasts were somewhat accurate, especially for the immediate next round, but there is room for improvement in longer-term predictions. It's crucial to monitor the market dynamics closely and adjust forecasts accordingly.

Given the current portfolio and market price, it might be beneficial to attempt buying 1-2 additional shares at a price below 14 to increase dividend earnings while minimizing the risk of loss at the buyback phase. However, patience and careful observation are key to avoid overpaying for stocks.

Moving forward, I plan to continue conservative trading, refine my price forecasting strategy, and adapt my approach based on market conditions.
