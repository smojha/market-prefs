Throughout the experiment, I observed a few key dynamics that influenced my trading strategy. Firstly, the market stability around the buyback price of 14 indicated that participants were aware of the future buyback price and traded accordingly. This insight was crucial in maintaining liquidity and flexibility in selling stock to maximize earnings. The strategy of submitting aggressive sell orders to ensure all stocks were sold at the buyback price of 14 proved effective, especially as the end of the experiment approached.

Accurate price forecasts were beneficial in earning additional cash rewards, which contributed to maximizing overall earnings. However, I noticed that my forecasts were not always within the 2.5 units of the actual price, which limited my bonus earnings. This suggests a need for more precise forecasting strategies in future experiments.

The practice rounds were instrumental in developing an understanding of the market dynamics and the importance of liquidity. The reflection after the practice rounds helped in passing along lessons learned, which were useful in the main experiment. The ability to adapt strategies based on market conditions and the remaining rounds was essential for effective trading.

In the main experiment, I initially focused on buying stocks to increase my holdings and benefit from dividends. However, towards the end, the emphasis shifted to selling stocks to ensure liquidation and maximize cash holdings. The market price stabilized around the buyback price in the later rounds, which reinforced the strategy of aggressive selling.

Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of adaptability in trading strategies. The combination of dividend earnings, interest on cash, and accurate forecasting contributed to a successful outcome. Future experiments should focus on refining forecasting techniques and maintaining a balanced approach to buying and selling stocks to optimize earnings.
