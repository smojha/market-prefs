During the practice rounds, I noticed that my submitted orders were not executed, likely due to uncompetitive limit prices. The market prices remained relatively stable at 14.0 and 15.0, indicating a cautious market environment. My dividend earnings varied significantly between rounds, reinforcing the importance of balancing stock ownership with cash holdings to optimize earnings. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my limit prices to be more competitive and continue experimenting with buying and selling to better understand market dynamics. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to market volume and executed trades to gain insights into market behavior and adapt my strategies accordingly.
