During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price for the STOCK remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14. This suggests that other participants are also aware of the future buyback price and are trading accordingly. My strategy of placing buy orders at 14 and sell orders slightly above the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating that there was no significant demand at higher prices. However, the stability at the buyback price confirms that accumulating stock at or below this price could be a viable strategy to maximize earnings at the end of the experiment. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor the market and adjust my orders based on the observed trends. I will also focus on submitting accurate price forecasts to earn additional cash rewards.
