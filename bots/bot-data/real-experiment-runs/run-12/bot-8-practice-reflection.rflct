During the practice rounds, I tested the market by submitting buy orders below the previous market price to understand price sensitivity. No trades were executed in the first two rounds, indicating that the market may not be responsive to prices significantly below the market price. The market price increased from 14 to 15 in the second practice round, suggesting potential upward momentum. My strategy of holding a mix of cash and stock has been effective in balancing dividend earnings and interest. The dividends earned were 1.6 and 4.0 in the first two rounds, respectively, which are significant compared to the interest earned. Given the market price of 15 in the last round and the stock trade-in value of 14, it may be prudent to consider selling some stocks if the price remains high to avoid losses at the end of the experiment. Additionally, conservative approaches in the initial rounds have helped prevent significant losses. Future strategies should focus on adapting to market dynamics and adjusting orders based on observed price movements.
