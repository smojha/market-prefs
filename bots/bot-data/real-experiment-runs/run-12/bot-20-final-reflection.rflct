Throughout the trading experiment, I gained several valuable insights that helped maximize my earnings. Initially, I focused on selling all remaining stock at or near the buyback price of 14 to maximize my cash holdings. This strategy was crucial, especially as the experiment neared its end. Holding cash was beneficial for maximizing interest earnings, and monitoring market dynamics allowed for successful trades. Buying stock at prices significantly higher than the buyback price would have resulted in losses at the end of the experiment. The market showed stability around the buyback price of 14, with recent prices hovering around 13. Adjusting limit prices and monitoring market dynamics were key to successful trades. The practice rounds provided a solid foundation for understanding market behavior and developing effective strategies. Overall, the experiment reinforced the importance of adapting strategies based on market conditions and focusing on maximizing cash holdings, especially towards the end of the trading period.
