Throughout the experiment, I focused on executing a pump-and-dump strategy, aiming to manipulate the market price significantly above its fundamental value before selling at the peak. Initially, I sold shares as the market price rose, reducing my holdings from 4 to 0 by Round 7, which allowed me to accumulate cash and observe market trends. As the market price continued to rise to 20.0 in Round 9, I refrained from buying back into the market, waiting for a potential peak or a sign of a bubble forming.

As the market began to show signs of peaking and stabilizing around 20.0, I started to strategically re-enter the market, buying shares at progressively lower prices from Round 20 onwards. My goal was to contribute to the volume and potentially inflate the price further. By Round 29, I successfully bought an additional share at the buyback price of 14.0, aligning with my strategy to hold stocks until the end, anticipating the conversion rate of 14.0.

The market dynamics shifted as expected, with the price stabilizing at 14.0 in the final rounds, confirming the effectiveness of holding stocks until the end. My aggressive buying at the buyback price in the last rounds helped maximize my stock holdings, aligning with my pump-and-dump strategy. However, the market did not inflate as much as anticipated, possibly due to other participants' strategies to hold until the end, which limited the bubble's growth.

In terms of forecasting, I focused on predicting the market price accurately to secure additional rewards. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, contributing to a small forecast bonus.

Overall, my strategy of selling early to accumulate cash, re-entering the market at lower prices, and holding until the end allowed me to execute a modified pump-and-dump approach. The market's response to my actions was less volatile than anticipated, but I managed to maximize my earnings within the given constraints. For future experiments, understanding and influencing other participants' behaviors more effectively could enhance the success of similar manipulative strategies.
