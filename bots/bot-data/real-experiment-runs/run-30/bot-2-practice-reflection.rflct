In the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback value of 14, indicating a relatively stable market with limited volatility. My strategy of attempting to buy at a lower price (13) did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that other participants may also be holding out for favorable prices or that the market liquidity is lower than expected. This experience has taught me the importance of flexibility in pricing to potentially execute trades and the need to closely monitor market trends, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where the buyback price becomes more relevant. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my buy orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trades while still aiming to capitalize on any dips below the buyback value. Additionally, my forecasts were slightly off, indicating a need for more accurate market price predictions to secure the additional cash rewards. Overall, the practice rounds have been instrumental in refining my approach to both trading and forecasting, and I will continue to adapt my strategies based on ongoing market dynamics and the proximity to the experiment's conclusion.
