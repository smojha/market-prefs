The trend towards the buyback value of 14 was a critical factor in decision-making, especially in the final rounds. Selling shares at or above the buyback value as the experiment nears its end is a strategy that effectively minimizes risk and maximizes returns. The accumulation of cash through interest and dividends, combined with strategic selling at optimal prices, has proven to be a successful approach in this trading environment.",
