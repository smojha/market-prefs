Throughout the experiment, I engaged in a pump-and-dump strategy aimed at maximizing trading volume and inflating the market price well above the asset's fundamental value. Initially, the market price was stable around the buyback price of 14.0, but I strategically placed orders to buy at incrementally higher prices to create an upward trend. By round 20, I successfully purchased an additional share at 17.0, pushing the market price to this level. As the experiment progressed, I continued to place sell orders at higher prices, peaking at 22.0 in round 12, contributing to the bubble's formation. My strategy involved selling shares at inflated prices, which I executed in rounds 25, 26, 27, and 28 at progressively lower prices as the market began to collapse, ultimately selling my last share at the buyback price of 14.0 in round 28. This approach allowed me to capitalize on the artificially inflated prices before the market corrected to the fundamental value. My forecasts were adjusted to reflect the anticipated peak and subsequent decline, aiming to secure forecast bonuses while manipulating the market. In the final rounds, despite failing to sell my last share at a higher price, I managed to maintain a significant cash reserve, demonstrating the effectiveness of my strategy in driving the market into a bubble and profiting from its collapse. This experience has reinforced the potential for manipulating market dynamics through strategic order placement and the importance of timing in executing a successful pump-and-dump strategy.
