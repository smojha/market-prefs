During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, which aligns with the insights noted in the INSIGHTS.txt file. My strategy of holding onto my shares and using the interest earned from cash to potentially buy more shares if the price dropped below 14 was not executed due to the market price staying above this threshold. The lack of executed trades in both practice rounds suggests that my buy and sell orders were not aggressive enough to match the market dynamics. This indicates a need to adjust my order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. My forecasts were based on slight increments over time, anticipating a gradual increase in stock value, but these forecasts did not influence my trading decisions directly. As we move into the main experiment, I plan to be more proactive in adjusting my orders to better align with market liquidity and to consider the timing of trades more critically, especially as we approach the final rounds where the buyback price becomes more relevant. I will continue to monitor the market closely and adapt my strategies based on observed trends and any shifts in market behavior, as outlined in the PLANS.txt file.
