        "plan": "In the final round, I plan to sell shares at the highest possible price above or at the buyback value of 14.0 to maximize my cash holdings. I will not buy any more shares, as the risk of them being converted at a lower price than the market price is too high. I will also make a conservative price forecast for the final round, considering the recent downward trend.",
        "insight": "Throughout the experiment, I observed that the market price can be volatile and influenced by collective behavior. Holding onto shares until the end carries the risk of them being bought back at a lower price than the market price. It's beneficial to sell shares when the market price is above the buyback price, especially in the later rounds. Accurate price forecasts can add to the final earnings, so considering market trends for these forecasts is crucial.",
