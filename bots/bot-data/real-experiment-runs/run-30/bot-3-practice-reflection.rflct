During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback value of 14.0, suggesting that this might be a stable equilibrium influenced by the guaranteed conversion rate at the end of the experiment. My strategy of placing conservative buy orders at or below the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating that I may need to adjust my order prices to be more competitive to participate actively in the market. The dividends and interest earned played a significant role in increasing my cash position, which aligns with my insight that these factors are crucial and should continue to be considered in my trading and forecasting decisions.

Moving forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely and adjust my trading strategy based on the effectiveness of my price forecasts. I will also consider using my forecasts more actively to guide my short-term trading decisions, especially as I approach the later rounds where the buyback value becomes more relevant. My goal remains to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds, balancing the potential gains from stock ownership with the security of cash holdings.
