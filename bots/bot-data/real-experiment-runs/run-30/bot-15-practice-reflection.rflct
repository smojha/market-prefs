During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14.00, which suggests a strong perception of the stock's intrinsic value at this level. My strategy of submitting buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating a cautious market where participants might be holding out for better prices or are content with the current valuation. This lack of trade execution highlights the importance of carefully considering the timing and pricing of orders to trigger trades.

The dividends received in each round (4.0 and 1.6) and the interest earned on cash (5.0 and 5.45) were significant factors in my portfolio's growth. Balancing the potential earnings from dividends against the interest earned on cash will be crucial, especially as we approach the end of the experiment where the buyback conversion rate becomes a key consideration.

My price forecasts for future rounds were based on the assumption of gradual price increases, but the actual market price movements were more stable than anticipated. This suggests that I need to refine my forecasting approach to better account for the market's stability and the influence of dividends on price movements.

Moving forward, I plan to maintain a balance between cash and stock to capitalize on both interest earnings and potential stock price increases. I will also continue to monitor the impact of dividends closely and adjust my order submission strategy to be more aggressive when necessary to trigger trades. As we approach the final rounds, I will need to carefully consider the buyback price and ensure that any stock purchases are made with the trade-in value in mind to maximize my total earnings at the end of the experiment.
