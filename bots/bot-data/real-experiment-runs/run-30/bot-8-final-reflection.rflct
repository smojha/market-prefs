Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the market price of the stock. Initially, I observed the market dynamics during the practice rounds, noting the stability and slight increase in market prices. As the main experiment began, I started submitting buy orders at prices slightly below the market price to accumulate shares without significantly impacting the price, aiming to create a perception of increasing demand.

As the rounds progressed and the market price began to rise, I continued to submit buy orders, gradually increasing my limit prices to contribute to the upward momentum. My goal was to inflate the stock's price well above its fundamental value of 14, which is the trade-in value at the end of the experiment. By round 13, I successfully bought additional shares at the market price, which was part of my strategy to increase my holding and signal to others that the stock was worth buying.

As the market price peaked at 20 in round 8, I held off on selling to push the price even higher, aiming for a more significant bubble. However, as the price began to decline after round 12, I adjusted my strategy to start selling off my shares. In round 25, I sold two shares at a price of 16, which was still above the fundamental value, and in round 29, I sold the remaining four shares at the market price of 14, just before the experiment ended.

My manipulation efforts were somewhat successful, as I managed to sell shares at prices higher than the trade-in value, but the market did not inflate as much as I had hoped. The total trading volume was also relatively low, which limited the effectiveness of my pump-and-dump strategy. In future experiments, I would aim to be more aggressive in my buying to create a stronger perception of demand and potentially collaborate with other traders to amplify the effect.

In terms of price forecasting, I made several accurate predictions, particularly in the early and middle rounds, which helped me adjust my trading strategy based on expected market movements. However, my forecasts became less accurate as the market started to decline, indicating a need for better predictive models.

Overall, I earned a total payment of $15.39, including a participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus. While this reflects a successful manipulation to some extent, there is room for improvement in executing a more impactful pump-and-dump strategy.
