During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated slightly around the buyback price of 14, which appears to be a significant anchor for market dynamics. In Round 1, the market price was exactly at the buyback price, and in Round 2, it increased slightly to 14.5, indicating a potential trend or reaction to market conditions. My strategy of holding onto the initial 4 shares and accumulating cash through dividends and interest proved effective, as my cash increased from 100 to 123.45 over the practice rounds, while maintaining a stock value of 58.0 based on the last round's market price.

The dividends received were variable, with 4.0 in Round 1 and 1.6 in Round 2, reflecting the random nature of dividend payouts. The interest earned on cash, at 5% per period, provided a steady increase in my cash reserves, which is crucial for future buying opportunities or as a buffer at the end of the experiment.

My forecasts for future rounds were incrementally increasing, suggesting an expectation of price appreciation. However, given the stability around the buyback price, I will need to reassess these forecasts to ensure they are realistic and potentially adjust them downwards if the market continues to stabilize around 14.

Looking forward, I plan to continue monitoring the market closely, particularly the relationship between the market price and the buyback price. If the market price consistently exceeds 14, selling shares to secure profits might be beneficial. Conversely, if it drops below 14, buying more shares could be advantageous, anticipating a return to the buyback price. I will also keep track of dividend trends to better understand the stock's intrinsic value over time.

Overall, the practice rounds have reinforced the importance of flexibility in strategy and the need to adapt based on emerging market trends and the behaviors of other participants. The insights gained will be crucial as I move into the main experiment, where maximizing total earnings will be the primary goal.
