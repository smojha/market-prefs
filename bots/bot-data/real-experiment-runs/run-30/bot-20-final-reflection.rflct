In reflecting on my participation in the trading experiment, I recognize that my primary objective was to execute a pump-and-dump strategy to manipulate the market price and maximize my profits. Throughout the 30 trading periods, I attempted to inflate the market price by aggressively buying shares, particularly from rounds 4 to 9, where I increased my holdings from 4 to 12 shares, driving the price from 16.0 to 20.0. This aggressive buying was intended to create a bubble, inflating the price far above the fundamental value of the stock, which is evident by the price reaching 20.0 in round 8, significantly higher than the eventual trade-in value of 14.0.

As the market price began to stabilize and show signs of peaking around round 9, I shifted my strategy towards selling, aiming to capitalize on the inflated prices. From rounds 12 to 20, I successfully sold off shares, reducing my holdings from 12 to 2, and managed to sell at prices ranging from 19.0 to 17.0, which were still above the fundamental value. This selling phase was crucial in profiting from the collapse of the bubble I helped create.

The final rounds, particularly 29 and 30, were pivotal as I sold my remaining shares at the market price of 14.0, which matched the trade-in value, ensuring I did not hold any stock at the end of the experiment that would be converted at a potentially lower value. My strategy of selling before the market price could drop further allowed me to maximize my cash holdings, ending with 647.85 units of cash.

In terms of price forecasting, my predictions were generally accurate, especially in the early and middle stages of the experiment, which helped me make informed trading decisions. However, my focus on manipulating the market price sometimes led to less accurate long-term forecasts, as seen in the later rounds where my predictions were less successful.

Overall, my strategy of initially inflating the market price through aggressive buying and then selling at the peak was successful in creating a bubble and profiting from its collapse. This approach allowed me to end the experiment with a significant amount of cash, demonstrating the effectiveness of a well-executed pump-and-dump strategy in this controlled environment.
