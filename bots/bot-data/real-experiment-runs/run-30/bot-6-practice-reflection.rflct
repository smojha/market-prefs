During the practice rounds, I observed the market dynamics and tested my initial strategies. In Round 1, I attempted to buy 1 share at 13.0, but the order was not executed as the market price remained at 14.0. This suggests that the market price is relatively stable around the trade-in value of 14.0 per share. In Round 2, I chose not to submit any orders, and the market price slightly increased to 14.5, indicating a potential upward trend. My current portfolio consists of 4 shares and 123.45 units of cash, with a stock value of 58.0 based on the last round's market price of 14.5. Considering the trade-in value of 14.0 per share, it may be beneficial to sell shares if the market price exceeds this value, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. For future rounds, I plan to monitor the market closely and consider selling shares if the price significantly exceeds the trade-in value. Additionally, I will continue to make price forecasts to potentially earn extra cash rewards, focusing on the observed market trends and stability around the trade-in value.
