In executing the pump-and-dump strategy, the goal was to inflate the market price of the STOCK far above its fundamental value and then sell at the peak. Throughout the experiment, I aimed to increase trading volume and manipulate market sentiment to create a bubble. The strategy involved buying shares to drive up demand and subsequently selling them at a higher price to capitalize on the inflated market value.

Initially, I observed that the market price was gradually increasing, which provided an opportunity to buy shares at a lower price and contribute to the upward trend. From rounds 6 to 10, I successfully purchased additional shares, which helped increase the market price from 18.0 to 20.0. This phase was critical in building the bubble, as more participants were drawn into buying due to the perceived upward momentum.

However, the market dynamics shifted around round 12, and the price began to stabilize and then decline. Despite attempts to sell at higher prices in rounds 13 to 20, no trades were executed, indicating a lack of buyers at the inflated prices. This highlighted the difficulty in sustaining the bubble once the market sentiment started to wane.

In the later rounds, from 24 to 30, I adjusted my strategy to sell shares at or near the buyback price of 14.0, recognizing the impending collapse of the bubble. The final sell order in round 30 at 14.0 was partially executed, allowing me to convert some shares into cash before the experiment ended.

Key insights from this strategy include the importance of timing in executing a pump-and-dump. The initial phase of inflating the price was successful, but sustaining the bubble required more aggressive selling at peak prices, which was not possible due to market resistance. Additionally, the gradual decline in market price towards the end validated the need to exit positions strategically before the bubble burst completely.

For future experiments, a more coordinated effort to sustain the bubble through continuous buying and selling at progressively higher prices could be more effective. Monitoring market trends closely and adapting quickly to changes in market sentiment will be crucial in maximizing the success of such a strategy.
