In executing the pump-and-dump strategy, my approach was to manipulate the market dynamics by inflating the stock price and increasing trading volume. Initially, I focused on selling my stocks at progressively higher prices, which I successfully did from rounds 4 to 8, selling at prices ranging from 16.0 to 20.0. This helped to drive the market price up, contributing to the bubble formation. However, I faced challenges in maintaining the momentum as the market price began to stabilize and then decline after reaching its peak in round 8.

To maximize the impact of the pump-and-dump strategy, I should have engaged more aggressively in buying stocks at lower prices to increase my holdings, thereby creating more opportunities to sell at inflated prices. The strategy of holding onto stocks until the market price was far above the fundamental value was partially successful, but I could have timed my final sell-off more effectively to capitalize on the peak price, which occurred at round 8 at 20.0.

In the later rounds, I noticed a trend where the market price started to revert towards the buyback price of 14.0. This indicated that other participants were also adjusting their strategies, possibly in response to the impending end of the experiment. My decision to sell my last share at 14.0 in round 29 was a strategic move to avoid holding any stock at the end, aligning with the buyback price and minimizing potential losses.

For future experiments, a more aggressive approach in the early and middle stages could be beneficial. This would involve buying stocks at lower prices to accumulate a larger position, then selling them off as the market price rises due to the created bubble. Additionally, closely monitoring market trends and other participants' behaviors could help in timing the peak of the bubble more accurately, thus maximizing profits from the sell-off.

In terms of the experiment's outcome, my total payment of $15.66 reflects the effectiveness of my strategy to some extent, though the forecast bonus was minimal, indicating room for improvement in predicting market movements more accurately. Overall, the experience provided valuable insights into market manipulation and the importance of timing and volume in executing a pump-and-dump strategy.
