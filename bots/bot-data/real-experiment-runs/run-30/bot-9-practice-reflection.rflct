During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback value of 14, which suggests a stable equilibrium. In Round 1, I successfully bought an additional share at the market price of 14, increasing my holdings to 5 shares. This decision was based on the potential for dividend earnings and the guaranteed buyback value at the end of the experiment. However, in Round 2, my attempt to buy another share at 14 did not execute as the market price rose to 14.5, and no trades occurred, indicating lower liquidity than expected. This experience underscores the importance of liquidity in executing trades at desired prices.

My current portfolio, entering Round 3, includes 5 shares valued at 72.5 based on the last round's market price and 109.17 in cash. The total trade-in value of my stocks at the end of the experiment would be 70, which is less than the current market value, suggesting a potential profit if I can sell at or above the current market price before the end of the experiment.

Looking forward, I will continue to monitor the market closely. If the price remains at or below 14, buying more shares could be beneficial due to the dividends and the buyback value. However, if the price continues to rise above 14, I might consider selling some shares to lock in gains, especially as we approach the end of the experiment. Balancing the potential returns from dividends and the buyback with the steady interest earned on cash will be crucial.

Regarding my forecasts, I need to refine my approach to improve accuracy, as none of my forecasts were within the 2.5-unit margin of the actual prices. This could potentially increase my earnings at the end of the experiment.

Overall, the practice rounds have highlighted the need for adaptability in strategy, careful consideration of market liquidity, and the importance of aligning my trading decisions with the end-of-experiment buyback value.
