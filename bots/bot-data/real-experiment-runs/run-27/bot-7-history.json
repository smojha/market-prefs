This suggests that participants are anchoring their trading decisions to perceived value levels. The lack of significant price movement after reaching 19.0 indicates a potential resistance level, which could be due to the anticipation of the buyback price at the end of the experiment. My successful sales at this price point have allowed me to capitalize on this trend. As we approach the final rounds, it will be crucial to reassess the value of holding cash versus stocks, considering both the interest rate and potential dividend income.
