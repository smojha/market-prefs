In this trading experiment, my primary goal was to execute a pump-and-dump strategy to maximize my profits by manipulating the market price. I started with 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock, and the key was to inflate the stock price far above its fundamental value before selling at the peak.

Initially, I focused on buying shares to increase demand and drive the market price up. As seen in the data, I consistently submitted buy orders at or slightly below the current market price, which led to an increase in my stock holdings from 4 to 11 shares by Round 8. This strategy was successful in pushing the market price from 14.0 in the practice rounds to 19.0 by Round 8.

However, as the market price approached the buyback value of 14, I shifted my strategy to selling. From Round 10 to Round 22, I executed a series of sell orders, successfully reducing my holdings to 0 shares. This was timed perfectly as the market price began to decline from 19.0 to 14.0 by Round 28, aligning with the buyback price.

My strategy of selling before the market price reached the buyback price was effective, as it allowed me to convert my stock into cash at a higher price than the final buyback value. By Round 30, I had no shares left and had maximized my cash holdings to 698.15 units, which is significantly higher than the initial 100 units.

In terms of forecasting, I aimed to predict the market price accurately to earn additional cash rewards. My forecasts were generally close to the actual market prices, which helped me earn a small forecast bonus of $0.10.

Overall, my pump-and-dump strategy was successful in inflating the market price and then selling at a profit before the price collapsed to the buyback value. This allowed me to end the experiment with a total payment of $15.59, including my participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus. Moving forward, I would refine this strategy by more aggressively buying to inflate the price earlier and selling even closer to the peak to maximize profits.
