During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated around the buyback value of 14, with the last round's price at 15. My strategy of placing buy orders slightly below the current market price and sell orders slightly above did not result in any executed trades, indicating limited liquidity or interest at those price points. Holding onto my initial 4 shares of stock was beneficial as the market price remained close to or above the buyback price, allowing me to benefit from the dividends and the potential for selling at a higher price. The 5% interest on cash provided a steady return, which I utilized to increase my cash holdings from 100 to 123.21 over the practice rounds, demonstrating the value of cash as a safe asset in this environment. My forecasts were generally optimistic, expecting the price to rise slightly over time, but none of the practice rounds extended far enough to test these longer-term predictions. Moving forward into the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy by buying stocks when the price dips below 14 and selling when it rises above 14, while continually assessing the trade-off between potential stock gains and the guaranteed return from cash. Additionally, I will need to monitor market liquidity more closely and adjust my order prices to increase the likelihood of trade execution. The insights from these practice rounds underscore the importance of balancing risk and reward, considering both the stock's potential for capital gains and dividends against the steady growth of cash holdings.
