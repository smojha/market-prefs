If the price remains stable or increases slightly, I will consider selling my shares at a price above 14 but below the current market price to secure a profit before the experiment ends. If the price drops below 14, I will hold onto my shares to benefit from the buyback. I will also continue to earn interest on my cash, so I will not rush to use all my cash to buy more shares unless the market price drops significantly below the buyback price. I will adjust my price forecasts based on recent trends and submit orders strategically to maximize my earnings at the end of the experiment.",
        "insight": "The market has shown a tendency to stabilize after fluctuations, which suggests a strategy of waiting for the right moment to sell could be effective. The dividends from holding stocks and the interest from holding cash provide a steady income, which should be factored into decisions about when to buy or sell. As we approach the final rounds, the strategy should shift more towards securing gains rather than speculating on price increases beyond the buyback value.",
