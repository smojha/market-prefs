During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, with slight increases in the subsequent rounds. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that other participants were also cautious around these price points. The stability near the buyback price suggests a general awareness among participants of the guaranteed value at the end of the experiment, which influenced my decision-making.

The dividends received (1.6 per round) added value to holding stocks, yet the 5% interest on cash provided a safe and consistent return, which influenced my decision to maintain a balanced portfolio. My cash increased from interest and dividends, which was beneficial but also highlighted the need for active trading to capitalize on potential price movements.

For the upcoming rounds, I plan to refine my strategy by possibly adjusting my buy and sell thresholds closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution. Monitoring market trends and volatility will remain crucial, and I will continue to balance my holdings between cash and stock, taking advantage of both the interest rate and potential stock price increases.

Regarding my forecasts, I noticed a slight upward trend in my predictions, which were generally accurate within the given range. This suggests that my understanding of market dynamics is improving, and I should continue to refine these predictions based on observed patterns.

Overall, the practice rounds provided valuable insights into market behavior and the importance of strategic flexibility. I will carry these lessons into the main experiment, aiming to optimize my trades and forecasts to maximize my total earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
