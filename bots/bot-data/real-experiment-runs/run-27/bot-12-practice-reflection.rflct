During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, suggesting a stable equilibrium point influenced by the guaranteed trade-in value at the end of the experiment. My strategy of placing buy orders slightly below and sell orders slightly above the market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating a cautious approach among participants. This cautiousness might be due to the alignment of the market price with the buyback price, making participants hesitant to trade at prices that might not be advantageous relative to the end-of-experiment conversion rate.

The dividends received reinforced the potential benefits of holding stocks, especially given the stability of the market price. The cash balance increased due to both interest and dividends, suggesting that a balanced approach of holding stocks and maintaining cash could be beneficial.

For price forecasting, my predictions were incrementally increasing, based on the assumption that the market might trend upwards slightly. However, the actual market prices remained close to the buyback price, suggesting that my forecasts need to be more conservative and closely aligned with the buyback value, especially as we approach the end of the experiment.

Moving forward into the main experiment, I will continue to monitor the market closely, adjusting my trading strategy based on observed liquidity and price movements. I will also refine my price forecasting to better align with the observed market stability and trends, ensuring that my predictions are more accurate to maximize forecast winnings. Additionally, I will keep in mind the importance of not overpaying for stocks near the end of the experiment, as their value will be capped at the buyback price.
