My strategy of selling shares at higher prices earlier in the experiment and then holding onto the remaining shares towards the end proved beneficial. The importance of balancing cash and stock to leverage both interest and dividend payments was crucial. As the experiment concludes, it is evident that a conservative approach in the final rounds, focusing on the buyback price, is optimal for maximizing earnings.",
