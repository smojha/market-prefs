Maintain a balance between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends and potential price increases.\n4.

The potential for stock price appreciation exists, but the risk of reverting to the buyback price at the end of the experiment necessitates a balanced strategy. Holding a mix of cash and stocks seems optimal, allowing for interest earnings while also positioning for dividend income and potential price increases. As the experiment progresses, adapting to market changes will be crucial.",
