Throughout the trading experiment, my primary strategy evolved from attempting to capitalize on market trends to executing a pump-and-dump scheme aimed at inflating the market price significantly above the asset's fundamental value. Initially, I observed that the market price tended to converge towards the buyback price of 14 as the experiment progressed, which informed my decision to hold onto shares towards the end. However, my focus shifted towards manipulating the market through increased trading volume and inflating the price.

In the early rounds, I engaged in minimal trading, focusing on accumulating shares and cash through dividends and interest. As the market price began to rise, I started buying more aggressively, particularly from Round 7 to Round 12, where I increased my share count from 4 to 10, contributing to the upward pressure on the price. This was part of the 'pump' phase of my strategy, where I aimed to create a perception of increasing value and demand.

By Round 17, I began the 'dump' phase, selling shares at the peak price of 18, reducing my holdings from 10 to 2 shares by Round 20. This move was intended to capitalize on the inflated price before it corrected back towards the fundamental value. The market price did eventually decline to 14 by Round 30, aligning with the buyback price, which I had anticipated and acted upon.

The effectiveness of my pump-and-dump strategy was evident in the increased trading volume and price volatility. However, the final market price of 14 at Round 30 indicates that the market eventually corrected, but not before I had sold most of my shares at a higher price. My total cash at the end was 631.06, with a trade-in value of 28 from the remaining 2 shares, resulting in a total payment of $15.38.

Key insights from this experiment include the importance of timing in executing a pump-and-dump strategy. The market's susceptibility to manipulation was higher in the middle rounds, where I could influence the price more effectively. Additionally, accurate price forecasting played a minor role in my earnings, with a small forecast bonus of $0.09, suggesting that while forecasting can add to earnings, the primary focus should be on trading strategy.

Moving forward, a more aggressive approach to inflating the market price and a quicker dump phase could potentially yield higher returns. Understanding market psychology and the behavior of other participants will be crucial in refining this strategy for future experiments.
