During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained stable around the buyback price of 14, suggesting a potential equilibrium point. This stability is crucial for strategizing, as it indicates that the stock's value may not significantly exceed the buyback price in the long term. I started with 100 units of cash and 4 shares of stock, and through the practice rounds, my cash increased due to interest and dividends, while my stock value fluctuated slightly with the market price.

In the first practice round, I chose not to trade, focusing instead on observing the market dynamics. The market price was exactly at the buyback price, and I earned a dividend of 1.6 and interest of 5.0, which increased my cash to 106.6. This round confirmed the importance of the dividends and interest in my overall earnings strategy.

In the second round, I attempted to buy a share at a lower price of 13, but the order was not executed as the market price rose to 14.5. This experience highlighted the need to understand market liquidity and the willingness of other participants to trade at various price points. My cash continued to grow, reaching 113.53, further emphasizing the benefit of holding cash for interest.

Entering the third practice round, the market price rose to 15, which is above the buyback price. With my current holdings of 4 shares and 123.21 in cash, I need to consider whether buying at this price would be beneficial, given the final buyback value. The total trade-in amount for my current shares would be 56, which is less than the current market value of 60, suggesting that holding might be advantageous if the price remains high or increases further.

For the upcoming main experiment rounds, my strategy will involve:
1. Continuing to monitor the market closely, especially around the buyback price.
2. Considering small trades to test market responsiveness and liquidity, as planned.
3. Balancing the benefits of holding cash for interest against the potential gains from stock dividends and price appreciation.
4. Being cautious about buying stocks at prices significantly above the buyback value as the experiment nears its end.

My forecasts for future rounds were based on the observed stability at 14 and slight increases, which I will refine as I gather more data during the main experiment. The insights from these practice rounds will guide my decision-making, with a focus on maximizing my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
