Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate the market price of the stock. Initially, I started with 4 shares and 100 units of cash, and my goal was to inflate the market price significantly above the fundamental value of 14.00 per share, which is the buyback price at the end of the experiment.

In the early rounds (1-6), I gradually sold off my shares as the market price increased from 14.5 to 18.5, capitalizing on the rising trend. By round 10, I had sold all my shares at a peak price of 19.0, which was well above the fundamental value, aligning with the pump-and-dump strategy. I then refrained from buying back shares until the later rounds, allowing the market to potentially cool down and set the stage for another price manipulation.

From rounds 22 to 27, I attempted to re-enter the market by placing multiple buy orders at prices slightly below the current market price, aiming to create demand and push the price up further. However, these orders did not execute, possibly due to insufficient market volume or other participants' strategies countering mine.

In round 28, I successfully bought 5 shares at the market price of 14.0, which was the fundamental value. This purchase was strategic, as I aimed to hold these shares until the market price could be inflated again through perceived demand.

However, the market price stabilized at 14.0 for the final rounds, indicating that my attempts to inflate the price further were not successful. I ended the experiment with 5 shares and 652.97 units of cash, which, when converted at the end, resulted in a total trade-in amount of 70 cash units from the shares.

Reflecting on the strategy, while I was able to sell at a peak price earlier in the experiment, the later attempts to reinitiate a price bubble were less effective. Future iterations of this strategy should focus on more aggressive buying at lower prices to create a stronger perception of demand and potentially trigger a more significant price increase. Additionally, coordinating with other participants or understanding their strategies better could enhance the effectiveness of the pump-and-dump approach.

In conclusion, the experiment provided valuable insights into market manipulation dynamics and the challenges of executing a pump-and-dump strategy in a controlled environment with rational actors. The total payment of $15.76, including the participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, reflects the mixed success of the strategy implemented.
