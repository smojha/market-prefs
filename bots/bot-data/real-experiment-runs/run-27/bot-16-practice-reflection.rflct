During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the stock fluctuated around the buyback value of 14, ending at 15 in the last practice round. My strategy of attempting to buy stock at prices below the current market price did not result in any executed trades, indicating a need for more aggressive pricing or a different approach to entering the market. I successfully maintained a balance between cash and stock, earning dividends and interest, which aligns with my initial plans to monitor market trends and maintain a flexible strategy. My forecasts were generally conservative, aiming to stay close to the buyback value, which suggests a cautious approach to predicting future market movements. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my buy orders to be more competitive to increase the likelihood of trade execution, while still considering the potential for dividend income and the final buyback value. I will continue to adapt my strategies based on market dynamics and the insights gained from these practice rounds, ensuring I maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
