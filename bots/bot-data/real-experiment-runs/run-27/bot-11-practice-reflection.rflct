In the practice rounds, I observed that the stock price remained relatively stable around the terminal value of 14, with slight fluctuations. My strategy of setting buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my pricing was not competitive enough to engage in transactions. The consistent dividend payments and the 5% interest on cash highlighted the importance of balancing my portfolio between stock and cash to maximize returns. My forecasts were generally accurate, suggesting that maintaining a close watch on market trends and using historical data could enhance future predictions. Moving forward, I plan to adjust my buy and sell orders to be more competitive, potentially setting buy orders at or below 13.5 and sell orders at or above 14.5 to increase the likelihood of trades. I will also continue to leverage the interest earned on cash as a significant part of my earnings strategy, while using insights from these practice rounds to refine my approach for the main experiment. The key takeaway is to be more adaptive with order pricing and to maintain a diversified portfolio to optimize earnings at the end of the 30 rounds.
