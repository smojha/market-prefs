During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price fluctuated slightly above the buyback price of 14.0, ending at 15.0 in the last practice round. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13.0 and a sell order at 15.0 did not result in any executed trades, indicating that my pricing might need adjustment to be more competitive in the market. The dividends received were consistent at 1.6 per round, which, combined with the 5% interest on cash, provided a steady increase in my cash holdings. My forecasts were based on slight increases over time, which aligns with the observed trend in market prices. Moving forward, I should consider adjusting my buy and sell orders closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of execution. Additionally, I need to keep a close eye on the relationship between the market price and the buyback price as the experiment progresses, especially as we approach the final rounds where the buyback price becomes more critical. The insights and plans documented in PLANS.txt and INSIGHTS.txt will guide my strategy adjustments, focusing on balancing my portfolio and adapting to market dynamics.
