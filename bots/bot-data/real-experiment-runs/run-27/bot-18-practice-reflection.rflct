During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price of the STOCK remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 14.0 and 15.0. My strategy of setting limit orders at 13.0 for buying and 15.0 for selling did not result in any executed trades, suggesting that my buy orders were too low and sell orders too high compared to the market's willingness to trade. This indicates a need to adjust my limit prices closer to the current market price to increase the likelihood of trades being filled, especially as we approach the main experiment rounds where maximizing earnings is crucial.

I also noted the importance of balancing my portfolio between cash and stock to leverage both the dividend payments and the interest earned on cash. The dividends, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 per share, along with the 5% interest on cash, are significant contributors to my total earnings. Therefore, maintaining a balanced approach that considers these returns will be essential in the main experiment.

Regarding price forecasting, my incremental adjustments based on observed market stability seem to be on the right track, as my forecasts for rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12 were within the acceptable range. This suggests that a careful and data-driven approach to forecasting will be beneficial in earning additional cash rewards.

As we move into the main experiment, I plan to refine my aggressive and conservative trading strategies further. The aggressive strategy might involve setting buy orders slightly above the current market price to secure stocks, especially as the end of the experiment approaches and the stock's value is set to be converted at 14.0 per share. The conservative strategy will focus on maintaining a higher cash reserve to benefit from interest earnings while still participating in the stock market to earn dividends.

Finally, considering the buyback price of 14.0 and the last round's market price of 15.0, I need to be cautious about purchasing stocks at prices significantly higher than the buyback value as the experiment nears its end. This will ensure that I do not overpay for stocks that will be converted at a lower rate, thereby maximizing my total earnings at the end of the 30 experiment rounds.
