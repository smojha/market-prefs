During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price hovered around the stock's buyback value of 14.0, suggesting that participants are anchoring their valuations to this figure, possibly influenced by the potential dividend earnings and the fixed end-game conversion rate. My strategy of submitting buy orders at 13.0 and sell orders at 15.0 did not result in any trades, indicating that the market did not move enough to cross my limit orders. This suggests a need to adjust my order prices closer to the market price to increase the likelihood of trade execution in future rounds.

The dividends received were consistent at 1.6 per round, which aligns with the expected average given the probabilities of high and low dividends. This reinforces the importance of considering dividend income when assessing the value of holding stocks. The interest earned on cash holdings also contributed positively to my portfolio, emphasizing the value of maintaining a balance between cash and stocks.

My price forecasts were based on an anticipated gradual increase in market price, which did not fully materialize as expected. This suggests that I need to refine my forecasting model to better account for market dynamics and participant behavior. As we approach the end of the experiment, it will be crucial to avoid overpaying for stocks, keeping in mind the fixed buyback price of 14.0.

Moving forward, I plan to adjust my trading strategy to be more aggressive in terms of order placement, potentially setting buy orders closer to or even at the market price to ensure trades are executed. I will also continue to monitor market reactions to dividend payouts closely and adjust my portfolio accordingly. My goal remains to maximize my total earnings by the end of the 30 experiment rounds, leveraging both stock dividends and cash interest, while refining my price forecasting to earn additional rewards.
