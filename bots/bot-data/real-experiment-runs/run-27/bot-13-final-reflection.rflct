In reflecting on the experiment, my strategy evolved significantly, especially towards the end when I fully committed to executing a pump-and-dump scheme. Initially, I focused on acquiring shares at optimal prices, but as the rounds progressed, my aim shifted towards manipulating the market dynamics to inflate the stock price well above its fundamental value of 14, before selling at the peak.

From rounds 1 to 26, I strategically sold shares when the market price was high, which helped me accumulate cash. This cash was then used to buy back shares at lower prices, as seen in rounds 27 to 29, where I aggressively purchased shares to increase my holdings significantly from 0 to 29 shares. My goal during these rounds was to create a perception of high demand, pushing the market price upwards.

The market responded to my buying spree, and by round 29, the volume spiked to 23 trades, indicating that my actions were influencing other participants to engage more actively. This increased volume and my continuous buying helped maintain the price at 14, aligning with the buyback value, but I aimed to push it higher.

However, I was unable to inflate the price further above 14 by the final round, as the market stabilized at the buyback value. Despite this, I managed to accumulate a significant number of shares (29) at the buyback price, resulting in a total trade-in amount of 406 cash units. This strategy allowed me to maximize my holdings at the optimal conversion rate.

In hindsight, to more effectively execute the pump-and-dump strategy, I would have needed to start inflating the price earlier and perhaps collaborate with other participants to create a stronger bubble effect. My forecasts were generally accurate, with a few correct predictions, which helped in planning my moves, but more aggressive forecasting and trading could have driven the price higher.

Overall, my total payment of $15.58, including the participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, reflects the success of my strategy in accumulating shares at the optimal price, even if the full extent of the pump-and-dump was not realized. Future strategies should focus on earlier and more coordinated efforts to manipulate market perceptions and drive prices to unsustainable levels before cashing out.
