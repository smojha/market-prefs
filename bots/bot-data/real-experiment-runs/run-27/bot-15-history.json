        "plan": "For the final round, I plan to hold onto my 5 shares of stock to benefit from the buyback at 14 per share. I will also submit a sell order slightly above the current market price to potentially capitalize on any last-minute price increases. My focus will be on maximizing my cash position at the end of the experiment by balancing my portfolio between stock and cash.",
        "insight": "Throughout the experiment, I observed that market prices fluctuated significantly but eventually stabilized near the buyback price as the final rounds approached. My strategy of adjusting buy and sell orders based on market trends and holding stocks for dividend income was effective. In the future, I should continue to monitor market trends closely and adjust my trading strategies dynamically, especially in the later stages of the experiment where the buyback price becomes crucial.",
