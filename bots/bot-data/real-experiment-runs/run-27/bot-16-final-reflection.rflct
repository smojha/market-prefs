Throughout the experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price significantly above the fundamental value of the stock before selling at the peak. Initially, I engaged in buying stocks at increasing prices to drive the market upward, as seen in rounds 2 through 6 where I purchased shares at progressively higher prices, contributing to a rise in market price from 15.0 to 18.5. This was intended to create a bubble, encouraging other participants to buy into the rising market.

As the market price reached 19.0 in round 7, I began to sell off shares to capitalize on the inflated prices. I successfully sold shares at 19.0 in rounds 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 21, which helped to maximize my cash holdings while the market was at its peak. My strategy shifted from inflating the market to selling off as the price started to stabilize or show signs of decline, ensuring I could profit from the bubble I helped create.

Towards the end of the experiment, as the market price began to decline back towards the buyback value of 14.0, I adjusted my strategy to hold onto my remaining shares, anticipating the final conversion to cash at the buyback price. In round 30, with the market price at 14.0, I submitted a BUY order at 14.0 and a SELL order at 15.0, aiming to potentially increase my stock holdings if the price dipped below 14.0 or to sell if there was an unexpected price spike.

Reflecting on the outcomes, my pump-and-dump strategy was moderately successful. I managed to sell shares at inflated prices, which resulted in a significant increase in my cash holdings. However, the market did not inflate as much as I had hoped, possibly due to other participants' strategies or market dynamics. My total payment of $15.80, including the participation fee, market bonus, and forecast bonus, indicates that while I was able to manipulate the market to some extent, the overall impact was limited.

For future experiments, I would consider more aggressive tactics to inflate the market price further and perhaps coordinate with other participants to create a stronger bubble. Additionally, I would continue to adapt my selling strategy more dynamically to capitalize on any unexpected market movements. The key takeaway is the importance of timing and understanding market psychology to maximize the effectiveness of a pump-and-dump strategy.
