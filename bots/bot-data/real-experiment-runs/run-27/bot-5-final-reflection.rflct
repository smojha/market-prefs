In this experiment, my primary strategy was to execute a pump-and-dump scheme, aiming to inflate the market price of the stock far above its fundamental value and then sell at the peak. Initially, I focused on buying shares at lower prices to accumulate a significant holding, as seen in rounds 17 through 25 where I consistently bought shares at the market price or slightly below, increasing my share count from 3 to 12. This accumulation phase was crucial in setting the stage for the pump phase of the strategy.

As the experiment progressed, I noticed a trend where the market price began to rise, reaching a peak of 19.5 in round 14. My buying activity during this period contributed to the upward pressure on the price, aligning with the pump-and-dump strategy's goal of inflating the market price. However, the market dynamics shifted in later rounds, with the price beginning to stabilize and then decline, dropping to 14 by round 30, which is the buyback price.

In the final rounds, I ceased buying and refrained from selling, as indicated in my plan to hold onto shares until the end, expecting the market price to align with the buyback price. This decision was influenced by the insight that selling near the end of the experiment, especially when the market price approached the buyback price, would not yield a profit above the automatic conversion value.

Reflecting on the effectiveness of the pump-and-dump strategy, it was partially successful in inflating the price during the middle rounds. However, the strategy's full potential was not realized due to the market's stabilization and eventual alignment with the buyback price. Future iterations could involve more aggressive buying and coordinated selling to maximize the price peak and subsequent profit from the dump phase.

In terms of forecasting, my predictions were generally accurate within the required range, earning a small bonus. However, the focus on the pump-and-dump strategy somewhat distracted from optimizing these forecasts, which could be improved in future experiments.

Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into market manipulation dynamics and the importance of timing in executing such strategies. For future experiments, a more refined approach to both the pump and dump phases, along with better integration of forecasting, could enhance the strategy's success.
