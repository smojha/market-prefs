During the three practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market around 14. My initial strategy of buying at 13 or lower and selling at 15 or higher did not result in any trades as the market price remained at 14 for the first two rounds and 14.5 in the third round. This suggests that the spread between my buy and sell prices might be too wide, or that other participants are employing similar strategies. 

Key observations:
- Market stability: The market price has not fluctuated significantly, hovering around the expected value. This could be due to the limited number of practice rounds and participants' cautious behavior.
- Ineffective trading strategy: My current strategy has not resulted in any trades, indicating a need for adjustments.
- Potential for tighter spread: A smaller difference between buy and sell prices might be necessary to execute trades, but this also increases the risk of losses.

For the main experiment, I plan to refine my strategy by considering the following:
- Narrower spread: Reduce the difference between buy and sell prices to increase the likelihood of trades.
- Dynamic adjustment: Adjust the buy and sell prices based on market trends and observed participant behavior.
- Value assessment: Evaluate the intrinsic value of the stock based on the dividend payout and the final buyback price of 14 to make more informed trading decisions. 
- Forecasting impact: Assess how price forecasting impacts trading behavior and incorporate forecast information into trading strategy. 

Additionally, I will monitor the market volume and order book (if available) to better understand market dynamics and identify potential trading opportunities.
