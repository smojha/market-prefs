During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price around 14. My limit buy and sell orders in round 2 were not executed, suggesting a lack of sufficient spread between buy and sell offers in the market.  My initial price predictions have been conservative, centered around 14.  For the main experiment, I plan to continue monitoring market behavior closely.  I will explore adjusting my limit order strategy, potentially widening the spread or employing more aggressive pricing to increase the likelihood of order execution. I also need to refine my price prediction strategy, possibly incorporating a wider range of potential price movements to improve forecast accuracy.  It's crucial to remember the final stock buyback price of 14, which sets an upper limit on the potential value of stock holdings.  This must be factored into future trading decisions, especially towards the later rounds.  The strategy of buying low and selling high is sound, but I also need to consider time decay with respect to the final buyback price of 14 and the compounding effect of cash interest.
