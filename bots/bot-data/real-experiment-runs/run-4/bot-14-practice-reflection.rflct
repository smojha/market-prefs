During the practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price around 14, which is the same as the final buyback price. My initial buy/sell orders were too wide and did not result in any trades.  I need to tighten my spreads to be more competitive in the market.  I also need to consider the fact that the stock will be bought back at 14 at the end of the experiment. This means I shouldn't buy stock much above 14, and I should probably try to sell any I have if the price rises significantly above that level. In the next few rounds I am going to try bracketing 14 with my orders.
