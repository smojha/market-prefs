Across the three practice rounds, the market price remained relatively stable around 14, with the last round closing at 14.5.  My limit buy and sell orders at 13 and 15 respectively were not aggressive enough to execute any trades. This suggests other participants may have similar price expectations or are operating with narrower bid-ask spreads.  It also highlights the importance of being more aggressive with order pricing to ensure participation in the market. 

Key observation: Even with no trades, cash increased each round due to the 5% interest.  Holding stock generated dividend income, but the fluctuations depending on the high/low dividend highlight the inherent volatility. 

Going forward into the experimental rounds, I need to implement a more dynamic trading strategy. This will include adjusting buy/sell orders closer to the prevailing market price, even if it means accepting slightly less profit per share. The small gains from successful trades will likely outweigh the consistent but smaller gains from interest. I will also explore submitting multiple orders with varying price points to better capture market fluctuations. For price forecasting, I will maintain the current strategy of predicting around 14-16 for the near future, adjusting as more data becomes available in the main experiment. I will try to take into account the influence of final round buyback price to avoid getting stuck holding depreciating assets.
