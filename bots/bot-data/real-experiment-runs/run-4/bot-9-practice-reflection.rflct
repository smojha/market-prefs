Across all three practice rounds, the market price remained relatively stable around the final conversion price of 14. My limit orders, designed to probe market dynamics and exploit potential undervaluation or overvaluation, were not filled in any of the rounds. This reinforces the observation from Round 1 about a potential anchoring effect around 14.  There seems to be a reluctance among participants to trade, possibly due to risk aversion or a lack of understanding of the market mechanics. 

For the main experiment, I will need to adjust my strategy.  Simply setting limit orders slightly away from 14 is not sufficient to induce trading. I will consider strategies that take advantage of the dividend payouts and interest rate. One such strategy could be to focus on accumulating cash in the early rounds to capitalize on the 5% interest, and then become more aggressive in buying stock closer to the end of the experiment when the market price is likely to rise due to the guaranteed buyback at 14.  I also need to explore the impact of larger order sizes to see if that can stimulate trading activity.  Additionally, I need to analyze the forecast accuracy to understand whether my predictions align with market behavior and adjust my forecasting strategy if needed.
