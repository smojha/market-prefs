Across the three practice rounds, the market remained largely inactive with no trades executed. The market price hovered around the buyback price of 14, suggesting this value acts as a strong anchor for participant behavior. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 in round 2 were not filled, indicating a lack of counterparties willing to trade at these prices. This reinforces the perceived stability around the buyback price.  For the main experiment, I will explore strategies to exploit potential deviations from this anchor price while remaining mindful of the inherent risk of holding stock near the end of the experiment given the fixed buyback value.
