After round 24, if the market conditions are right, start reducing exposure towards a full cash position by 30.\nRounds 17-19: Re-accumulate shares, but with more caution. Target a buy price of 13.5, recognizing the market's resistance to higher prices.  Start with smaller buy orders to avoid overpaying if the price spikes unexpectedly. Monitor market volume and adjust strategy if volume increases.",

Despite this setback, my cash position is strong. Market remains resistant to price movements above 14. Will revise my accumulation strategy to be more conservative, prioritizing lower buy prices. Market continues to hover around 14, with low volume. Re-accumulated some shares, but proceeding cautiously.",
