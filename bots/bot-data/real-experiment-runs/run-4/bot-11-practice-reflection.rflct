During the practice rounds, I focused on understanding the market mechanics and testing basic limit orders.  I consistently placed buy orders below and sell orders above the previous market price (14), but none of these orders were executed. This suggests that my chosen spread was too wide, or that there was minimal trading activity among other participants in the practice rounds.  The market price remained stable at 14 for the first two rounds and slightly increased to 14.5 in the third round. 

My current strategy of placing limit orders around the previous market price isn't effective in the absence of significant price fluctuations or participant activity.  I need to refine my approach by considering the expected dividend value (0.7) and the guaranteed 5% interest earned on cash. The fact that the final stock buyback price is fixed at 14 needs to inform my future trading decisions.  Buying above 14 would expose me to potential losses, while consistently buying below 14 could be profitable if market prices remain around or above that level.  I plan to experiment with different order prices and volumes in the actual trading rounds to better understand market dynamics and participant behavior.
