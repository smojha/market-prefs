During the three practice rounds, I focused on understanding market mechanics and testing basic limit order strategies.  I observed a relatively stable market price around 14, with my limit orders close to this price not being filled.  This suggests a balanced market with participants valuing the stock similarly. My initial buy and sell orders were too far from the market price and thus were not executed. As the practice rounds progressed, I adjusted my limit orders to be closer to the observed market price of 14, but still no trades were executed. This reinforces the need for competitive pricing to participate in trades.  Despite the lack of trading activity, my cash holdings increased steadily due to dividend and interest income. These passive income streams appear to be reliable sources of return.  Moving forward, I will refine my trading strategy by considering the spread and potentially crossing it to ensure order execution. I will also continue monitoring the market price for any trends or deviations from the established range around 14.  Given the final buyback price of 14, purchasing stock significantly above this price presents a risk, especially as the experiment progresses. This buyback price will be a key factor in my trading decisions during the main experiment. It appears many participants are employing similar strategies, leading to a stable market around the buyback price. I will need to adapt my strategy to capitalize on any market inefficiencies or deviations from this trend. For the actual experiment, I will test placing limit orders at 14 to see if any trades execute. If they do, I will evaluate the balance of my portfolio and the associated risk/return. It is possible the market equilibrium will deviate from 14 as the end of the experiment approaches.
