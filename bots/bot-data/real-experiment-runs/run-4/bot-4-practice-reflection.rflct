During the three practice rounds, I observed a relatively stable market price hovering around 14. My limit buy and sell orders at 13 and 15, respectively, did not execute, suggesting a narrow bid-ask spread and potentially a lack of significant price fluctuations.  I maintained my initial holdings of 4 shares and accumulated cash through dividends and interest.  It appears that other participants may also be employing a conservative strategy during these practice rounds.  Moving forward into the experimental rounds, I will continue to monitor market behavior and adjust my trading strategy based on observed price volatility and trading volume.  It's crucial to consider the guaranteed buyback price of 14 when making trading decisions. Buying above this price carries inherent risk, while buying below presents an opportunity for profit. A key element of my strategy will be to exploit deviations from the fundamental value (14) while managing risk.  I will also experiment with widening the bid-ask spread on my limit orders to gauge market depth and responsiveness. Further, incorporating the potential dividend payouts into the valuation of the stock will be important in my decision making.
