During the practice rounds, the market price remained relatively stable around 14. My limit buy orders at 13 were not filled, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at that price.  It's important to note that trade volume has been zero in the practice rounds, indicating limited trading activity among participants. Since the stock's final value is 14, buying above that price carries risk.  My current strategy of waiting for lower prices or signs of increased trading activity seems reasonable, but I need to be prepared to adapt as the actual trading rounds begin. I also need to consider how dividend payouts and interest accumulation on cash holdings factor into the overall return.  For now, I will continue to hold my existing shares and cash while cautiously observing market behavior.  As the real rounds start, I will closely monitor actual trade volumes and price movements to fine-tune my buying and selling strategies. Additionally, I will factor in the potential benefit of dividends while holding shares.
