Across the three practice rounds, I was unable to execute any trades.  My buy orders at 13 and sell orders at 15 were consistently outside the market clearing price of 14.  This suggests a relatively stable market during the practice phase, with little price volatility.  Dividend payouts varied (1.6 in round 1, 4.0 in round 2), highlighting the probabilistic nature of this income source.  Interest income steadily increased due to compounding.  Moving forward, I need to adjust my trading strategy to better match the observed market behavior.  I will try narrowing the bid-ask spread on my orders in the next rounds to increase the likelihood of execution.  Specifically, I will aim for buy orders slightly below 14 and sell orders slightly above.  I will also continue to monitor market prices and volumes to refine my understanding of market dynamics and inform my long-term trading strategy.  My initial price forecasts of 14 seem reasonable given the observed stability, but I will re-evaluate this as more data becomes available.
