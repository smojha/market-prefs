During the practice rounds, I observed that my limit orders were not executed due to significant differences between my set prices and the prevailing market price. I adjusted my strategy in each round, narrowing the gap between my buy and sell limits and the market price. However, I still did not achieve any successful trades.  This suggests a very tight market with little price fluctuation and potentially few participants actively trading.  I need to be more aggressive in crossing the spread to get fills. It appears the market may be relatively stable around 14, which aligns with the fixed buyback price. This reinforces the importance of not overpaying for stock, especially in later rounds. My forecasting strategy has been to predict 14 consistently, given the stability observed so far. Moving forward into the actual trading rounds, I will prioritize getting fills, even if it means accepting slightly less favorable prices, and will monitor market behavior for any shifts in trends or increased volatility to capitalize on trading opportunities. I also need to consider the dividend payout rate when deciding whether to hold or sell shares.
