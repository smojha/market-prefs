Across all three practice rounds, none of my limit orders were executed.  This suggests a lack of market depth or participation from other players during these initial rounds.  It is also possible that others are employing the same strategy (bracketing 14). My buy and sell orders have consistently bracketed the market price of 14, which appears to be the equilibrium price given the 0.7 expected dividend and 5% interest rate. It also appears to be the terminal payout of 14.  Going forward, I should modify my strategy in a few ways:

1. **Explore price discovery:** Place orders further away from the previous market price to probe for the current bid-ask spread and gauge market depth. This will help understand how other participants are valuing the stock.
2. **Consider order size:** Experiment with different order sizes to see if it influences execution.  Larger orders might signal stronger conviction and potentially attract counterparties, while smaller orders may be more easily filled in a thin market.
3. **Dynamic strategy:** As rounds progress in the actual experiment, I need to adapt to observed market behavior and try to anticipate trends. The current strategy of bracketing 14 is not resulting in any trades, so it is not useful.  I need to acquire or discover price information. Given the predictable interest rate and dividend distribution, I hypothesize there are profitable arbitrage opportunities within the market.
4. **Forecast refinement:** While my forecasts were consistently 14, this reflects a naive strategy and may not hold true as the market evolves.  I will aim to incorporate more information, including observed prices and volumes, to improve forecast accuracy.
