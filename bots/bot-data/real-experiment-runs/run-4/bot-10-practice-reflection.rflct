Across the three practice rounds, the market price hovered consistently around 14, with no successful trades executed. My limit orders, designed to probe the market boundaries, were consistently outside the spread, indicating a narrow and stable market.  This stability reinforces the potential for a strategy focused on dividend and interest income, especially given the stock's guaranteed buyback price of 14.  Predicting market prices accurately seems achievable given the current low volatility, and should be a priority for additional cash earnings.  Moving forward, I'll continue to monitor market behavior, but will prioritize maximizing returns from dividends and interest, with careful consideration of any trades that deviate significantly from the established price range. I will also begin to adjust my forecasting based on the previous round data.
