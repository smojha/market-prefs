During the practice rounds, I focused on testing market behavior and refining my trading strategy. My limit orders were placed slightly above and below the previous market price to gauge price sensitivity. No trades were executed in the practice rounds, indicating a relatively stable market around the buyback price of 14. This reinforces the insight that large deviations from the buyback price are unlikely, especially in the short term.  I observed that the market price remained close to 14, fluctuating only slightly. This further supports the importance of precise limit order placement for successful trades, especially when spreads are tight. Moving forward, I will continue to monitor market trends and adjust my strategies accordingly, considering factors such as the buyback price, market sentiment, and spread dynamics.
