During the practice rounds, the market price remained stable around 14, close to the final buyback price. My limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 16 were not executed, indicating a lack of significant price fluctuations.  This suggests other participants are also aware of the buyback price and are not deviating significantly from it.  My price predictions were conservative, aiming for accuracy rather than large changes. Moving forward, I need to consider more aggressive trading strategies to capitalize on any potential price swings. Simply holding and earning dividends might not be the most profitable approach. I will explore strategies to identify and exploit temporary mispricing by other participants. I will also continue to refine my price forecasting model and consider a wider range of potential prices to maximize potential forecast earnings.
