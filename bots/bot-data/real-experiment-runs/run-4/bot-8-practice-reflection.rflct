During the practice rounds, I observed a consistent market price around 14, which aligns with the final buyback price. My limit orders were placed relatively close to this price (12-16 initially, then 13-15), but none were executed.  This suggests a relatively narrow bid-ask spread among other participants. 

My forecasting has been accurate so far, predicting 14 for most rounds, which proved correct.  I slightly adjusted the long-term forecast to 15 in round 2, acknowledging the possibility of minor fluctuations. 

Going forward into the experiment rounds, I will initially maintain a conservative approach. I will continue to target prices close to 14, but will consider widening the spread slightly to potentially capitalize on larger price swings if they occur.  I'll also closely monitor market volume and price trends to refine my forecasting and trading strategy. The key observation is the inactivity of the market in the practice rounds, which implies a strong anchoring to the buyback price of 14.  This suggests that profits might come from either correctly predicting and capitalizing on deviations from this anchor, or from exploiting the 5% interest on cash holdings if the market remains static. If I observe any consistent deviations from 14, I will adjust my buying/selling strategies accordingly. It is also important to monitor others behavior. If others start being aggressive buyers or sellers and move the market, this could be an indicator to do the opposite of them (sell when everyone is buying, buy when everyone is selling). Finally, with regard to the forecasting exercise, if the market remains largely unchanging from 14, this can provide opportunities to maintain perfect forecasting accuracy and secure consistent bonus reward through this mechanism.
