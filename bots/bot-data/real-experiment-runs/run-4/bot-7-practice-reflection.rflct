During the practice rounds, I observed that the market price remained relatively stable around the buyback price of 14.  In rounds 2 and 3, I placed limit orders to buy at 13 and sell at 15 to test market responsiveness.  These orders did not execute, suggesting a lack of other participants willing to trade at those prices.  My current strategy is to continue observing market behavior in the initial rounds of the experiment and to make conservative price forecasts around the buyback price.  I will adjust my trading and forecasting strategies as I gather more data on market dynamics and participant behavior.  It appears that selling for more than 14 is very difficult currently, and buying for less than 14 is similarly difficult.  I am starting to think this market is designed to have very low liquidity and high predictability. I will need to start thinking about strategies to deal with that.  I need to collect some more information to determine if other participants are acting rationally, or have predictable biases or errors.
