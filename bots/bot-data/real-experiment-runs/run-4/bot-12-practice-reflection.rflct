Across the three practice rounds, the market price remained relatively stable around the fundamental value of 14. My limit orders at 13 (buy) and 15 or 17 (sell) were not executed, indicating a lack of significant price fluctuations. This suggests a generally efficient market in these practice rounds, making it difficult to exploit price discrepancies.  For the main experiment, I'll need to consider strategies that account for this market efficiency and potentially focus on accumulating shares when prices dip below 14 and selling when they rise slightly above. It's also worth exploring the impact of order size on price, as tested in round 3, and whether larger orders can create more favorable execution opportunities.  I anticipate the real experiment will involve more dynamic price movements due to a larger number of participants and varying strategies, so adapting to changing market conditions will be key.
