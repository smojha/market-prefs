Across the three practice rounds, the market price remained relatively stable around 14, with no trades executed in my portfolio.  My limit orders in round 2 (buy at 13, sell at 15) were not filled, indicating a narrow spread and a lack of aggressive trading behavior from other participants.  This suggests a general hesitancy to deviate significantly from the initial price. The consistent dividend payouts and 5% interest on cash contribute to steady portfolio growth even without active trading.  For the main experiment, I will explore placing limit orders closer to the prevailing market price to increase the likelihood of execution. I will also monitor the volume traded in each round as an indicator of market activity and adjust my strategy accordingly.  Furthermore, I will experiment with adjusting forecasts in response to observed price and dividend trends.
