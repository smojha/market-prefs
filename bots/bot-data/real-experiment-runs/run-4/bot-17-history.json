Buy slightly above previous market price, sell slightly below.\n- **Mid-game (6-25):** Analyze data from initial rounds and adjust strategy based on market trends and participant behavior. Monitor volume and price fluctuations. If trends emerge, trade accordingly. If stability persists around 14, prioritize maintaining stock and earning dividends while seeking opportunistic trades.\n- **End-game (26-30):** Begin selling off stock gradually to maximize cash holdings before the final round to secure profit and avoid the fixed buyback. If market prices rise significantly above 14, sell more aggressively. If prices remain stable, sell strategically to avoid losses. \n- **Adapt:** Continuous adaptation to market conditions and other participants' strategies is paramount. \n- **Dividend influence:** Consider the impact of the dividend payout on overall returns. If dividends are consistently high, holding stock might be more profitable than frequent trading.\n\n*Added to Plans for round 6-10*: Lower buy limit to market price or slightly above, and increase sell limit slightly above market price to adapt to the current market stability and capture potential fluctuations.\n\n*Added for rounds 7-15:* Aim to increase share holdings to maximize potential dividend earnings while maintaining a moderate level of cash for future trade opportunities. Consider widening the spread between buy and sell orders to avoid losses from frequent crossing, but remain prepared to cross the spread strategically to capitalize on significant price fluctuations.\n\n*Added for rounds 8-15*:  If market remains stagnant, employ aggressive spread crossing strategies to force trades and gather more data.  Prioritize buying to increase potential dividend income.\n\n*Added for rounds 9-25*: Aggressively acquire stock below or at market price (14). Prepare exit strategy for rounds 26-30.\n\n*Added for rounds 10-20:* Continue aggressive stock acquisition at or below market price (14). Begin formulating a detailed exit strategy for rounds 21-30, considering factors such as accumulated dividends, potential market fluctuations, and the fixed 14 buyback price.\n\n*Added for rounds 11-20:* Maintain current stock levels and begin testing sell orders at slightly above market price (15).  Prepare for more active selling starting round 21.\n",
        "insight": "First successful trade executed in round 4, confirming the necessity of aggressive order placement to overcome the low market activity. The market continues to show signs of stability around the 14 mark, potentially influenced by the buyback price. The limited volume suggests either a low number of active traders or a prevailing strategy focused on long-term holding until the final rounds. Continued aggressive buying and selling within reasonable limits is key to gathering more market data and refining strategies. Focus on executing trades, even at slightly less favorable prices, to acquire a better understanding of participant behavior.\n\n*Added insight after round 5*: Confirmed price stability around 14 in the first 5 live rounds. Successfully executed two buys by crossing the spread, demonstrating this as a viable strategy to acquire shares. Need to further refine buy/sell order placement to balance aggressiveness and optimal prices.\n\n*Added insight after round 6:* Observed no trades in round 6 despite lowered buy and slightly raised sell order limits, indicating continued market stability and potentially low trade activity.  Need to continue refining order placement to participate in the limited trading opportunities. \n\n*Added insight after round 7:* No trades executed despite maintaining buy/sell orders at the market price, reinforcing the extreme stability and low activity. More aggressive strategies are needed to trigger trades and gain market experience.\n\n*Added insight after round 8:* Successful buy executed via spread crossing, further reinforcing this tactic's effectiveness in the current market.  Market stability persists.\n\n*Added insight after round 9:* Another successful buy executed via spread crossing, confirming the strategy's continued effectiveness in this stable market. The challenge now shifts towards balancing further share accumulation with the upcoming need to liquidate before the final rounds.\n\n*Added insight after round 10:* Successfully purchased another share via spread crossing, demonstrating the continuing efficacy of this approach. The market's consistent stability around 14 strengthens the argument for accumulating shares for dividend income, but the approaching end-game necessitates a clear exit plan to convert those shares to cash.",

Willing to cross the spread and accept less favorable prices to ensure fills. Buy slightly above previous market price, sell slightly below.\n- **Mid-game (6-25):** Analyze data from initial rounds and adjust strategy based on market trends and participant behavior. Monitor volume and price fluctuations. If trends emerge, trade accordingly. If stability persists around 14, prioritize maintaining stock and earning dividends while seeking opportunistic trades.\n- **End-game (26-30):** Begin selling off stock gradually to maximize cash holdings before the final round to secure profit and avoid the fixed buyback. If market prices rise significantly above 14, sell more aggressively. If prices remain stable, sell strategically to avoid losses. \n- **Adapt:** Continuous adaptation to market conditions and other participants' strategies is paramount. \n- **Dividend influence:** Consider the impact of the dividend payout on overall returns. If dividends are consistently high, holding stock might be more profitable than frequent trading.\n\n*Added to Plans for round 6-10*: Lower buy limit to market price or slightly above, and increase sell limit slightly above market price to adapt to the current market stability and capture potential fluctuations.\n\n*Added for rounds 7-15:* Aim to increase share holdings to maximize potential dividend earnings while maintaining a moderate level of cash for future trade opportunities. Consider widening the spread between buy and sell orders to avoid losses from frequent crossing, but remain prepared to cross the spread strategically to capitalize on significant price fluctuations.\n\n*Added for rounds 8-15*:  If market remains stagnant, employ aggressive spread crossing strategies to force trades and gather more data.  Prioritize buying to increase potential dividend income.\n\n*Added for rounds 9-25*: Aggressively acquire stock below or at market price (14). Prepare exit strategy for rounds 26-30.\n\n*Added for rounds 10-20:* Continue aggressive stock acquisition at or below market price (14). Begin formulating a detailed exit strategy for rounds 21-30, considering factors such as accumulated dividends, potential market fluctuations, and the fixed 14 buyback price.\n\n*Added for rounds 11-20:* Maintain current stock levels and begin testing sell orders at slightly above market price (15).  Prepare for more active selling starting round 21.\n\n*Added for rounds 12-20:* Focus on selling existing shares at or slightly above market price (15-16).  Pause active buying unless significant dips occur.\n\n*Added for rounds 13-25:* Aggressively sell shares at 14 to ensure liquidation before the final rounds.  Accept the market price to secure cash. Prepare for increased selling activity in rounds 26-30.\n\n*Added for rounds 14-25:* Continue aggressive selling at or slightly below market price (14) to liquidate remaining shares.\n",
        "insight": "First successful trade executed in round 4, confirming the necessity of aggressive order placement to overcome the low market activity. The market continues to show signs of stability around the 14 mark, potentially influenced by the buyback price. The limited volume suggests either a low number of active traders or a prevailing strategy focused on long-term holding until the final rounds. Continued aggressive buying and selling within reasonable limits is key to gathering more market data and refining strategies. Focus on executing trades, even at slightly less favorable prices, to acquire a better understanding of participant behavior.\n\n*Added insight after round 5*: Confirmed price stability around 14 in the first 5 live rounds. Successfully executed two buys by crossing the spread, demonstrating this as a viable strategy to acquire shares. Need to further refine buy/sell order placement to balance aggressiveness and optimal prices.\n\n*Added insight after round 6:* Observed no trades in round 6 despite lowered buy and slightly raised sell order limits, indicating continued market stability and potentially low trade activity.  Need to continue refining order placement to participate in the limited trading opportunities. \n\n*Added insight after round 7:* No trades executed despite maintaining buy/sell orders at the market price, reinforcing the extreme stability and low activity. More aggressive strategies are needed to trigger trades and gain market experience.\n\n*Added insight after round 8:* Successful buy executed via spread crossing, further reinforcing this tactic's effectiveness in the current market.  Market stability persists.\n\n*Added insight after round 9:* Another successful buy executed via spread crossing, confirming the strategy's continued effectiveness in this stable market. The challenge now shifts towards balancing further share accumulation with the upcoming need to liquidate before the final rounds.\n\n*Added insight after round 10:* Successfully purchased another share via spread crossing, demonstrating the continuing efficacy of this approach. The market's consistent stability around 14 strengthens the argument for accumulating shares for dividend income, but the approaching end-game necessitates a clear exit plan to convert those shares to cash.\n\n*Added insight after round 11*: No trades occurred this round.  The market is very resistant to moving from 14. Time to try selling some shares at a slightly elevated price.\n\n*Added insight after round 12*: No trades despite listing sell orders at 15. Market extremely resistant to upward movement. Need to aggressively sell to secure cash before the end of the game.\n\n*Added insight after round 13:* Successfully sold 2 shares at 14, demonstrating the effectiveness of aggressive selling in this stable market.  Need to continue selling the remaining shares.",
